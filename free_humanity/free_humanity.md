> *practically every ethical, moral, and cultural justification for the capitalist system has now been destroyed by capitalism*  
> [**Michael Harrington**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Harrington)  

&nbsp;

technology moves humanity forward, but there is a price to pay for that progress:  

  * **identity:** your identity is virtual, it is not based on verifiable reality  
  * **privacy:** you have no privacy, companies buy and sell your personal·information without your knowledge    
  * **security:** the companies who store your valued personal·information do not take its security seriously, which allows bad·actors to obtain it and sell it to anyone for any purpose, including identity theft  

these are dire times for people’s privacy  
· some companies are dishonest about their business·practices  
· others may have their heart in the right place but hire incompetent personnel who do not know how to secure the personal·information of their employer’s human customers  
· yet other companies blatantly break laws and regulations, and buy, sell, or use personal·information in nefarious ways  
&nbsp;

these are not great times for personal·safety on the internet, but better times are coming  
· the future is bright  
· we, the people, can make it real, together  

we do not have to take this anymore  
· we have the power to overcome negligence, incompetence, and crime perpetuated by the big internet corporations who cannot see past their greedy noses  
· we have the power to create a network of us, for us, and by us  
· *our power is our data*  
· the [**human·internet**][human·internet] will bring about an era of real identity, guaranteed privacy, and reliable security for us and our data  
&nbsp;

the way people navigate content on the internet is antiquated  
· in the era of immersive·gaming, virtual·reality, and augmented·reality, people deserve more compelling ways of navigating the web, such as the revolutionary ideas of [**Ted Nelson**][Ted·Nelson], the original inventor of hypertext and hypermedia  
· the for·profit companies that implemented the internet many years ago did not see the need for the more humanistic ideas that Nelson spoused for navigating hypermedia  
· it is time for those ideas to be put in the hands, eyes, and ears of humanity, starting with colleges and universities, where most revolutionary ideas take flight  
· students, teachers, and researchers will benefit from more efficient ways to link their work to their colleagues’ work  
&nbsp;

this article, using hallowed documents, authored by people using lessons learned over thousands of years, defines ourselves, who we are, what we stand for  
· it imagines a future where data and content rule over platforms, and advancements in technology benefit humanity before satisfying profit·making needs of greedy entities  
· it then depicts our present, showcasing recent headlines that illustrate how the for·profit internet behemoths really think about personal·data and privacy  
· finally, it shows how the human·internet can take humanity from the confines of our present into valleys of humanistic collaboration  
· this is the interconnected, distributed network that will take humanity forward and upward to [Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars), [Europa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Europa_(moon)), [Enceladus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enceladus), [Proxima b](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b), and beyond

## WE THE PEOPLE
human beings have developed concepts like human·rights and justice to ensure that individuals, groups, and societies survive, and live happily, freely, and safely  
· we have to right to protect such qualities when they are imperiled thru abuse, negligence, incompetence, or crime

### human rights

[Universal Declaration of Human Rights](http://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights)

> Article 12.  
> No one shall be subjected to **arbitrary interference with [eir] privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon [eir] honour and reputation.** Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.

> (2) **No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of [eir] property.**

> Article 19.  
> Everyone has the right to **freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers.**

> Article 21.  
> (1) Everyone has the right to take part in the government of [eir] country, directly or through freely chosen representatives.

### abuses and usurpations
[United States Declaration of Independence—Preamble](http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document)

> We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all [persons] are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
> That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among [people], deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, That **whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness.**  
> Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that [people] are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed.  
> But **when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.**
> Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government.  
> **The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.**

Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, Microsoft and other big internet companies effectively *govern* the internet  
· they constantly abuse, and usurp our human rights to privacy, security, and safety  
· it is our right, our duty, to *disrupt* them, and to develop better, private, and secure mechanisms to connect, relate, live, and do business on the internet

## OUR FUTURE

> *lie*  
> [**Personal Super Intelligent AI System**](https://youtu.be/NZ8G3e3Cgl4 "YouTube: A Date in 2025")  

&nbsp;

***personal business is smooth and efficient with a single, distributed, resilient, and permanent store for all our personal·information***

let us travel to the future for a few minutes, and hang out with a human·internet denizen  
· eir name is Mirai  
· sie just moved to a new state after getting a job at a fusion·energy research facility  

changing primary·care facilities and healthcare providers is easy for Mirai  
· all sie does is go the new facility and give it access to eir digital medical·records  
· the medical professionals in the new facility now have access to eir entire medical·history, sie does not have to fill the annoying forms people used to do before  
· sie shudders when sie reads the horror stories about hackers stealing personal·information   
· “i am glad people rebelled and fought to make things better,” Mirai thinks to eirself  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***human interactions are simple and satisfying with smart·software***  
  
at the clinic, Mirai meets, Robin  
· Mirai tells Robin that sie is a new arrival  
· Robin welcomes Mirai to the city  
· the two have a nice conversation about biochemistry and become fast friends  
· when eir name is called, Robin takes out eir handset and calls up eir connection·assistant  
· Mirai does the same  
· then their handsets present invitations to each of them to connect with one another  
· after biometrically authenticating to their handsets, Mirai and Robin accept their mutual friend·connection requests  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***digital·assistants help people perform tasks***  

that night, at eir new place, Mirai sits at eir couch and picks up eir tablet  
· sie instructs the communication·assistant to start a videochat with eir mom  
· however, because eir mom is running, the assistant suggests a voicechat, and sie accepts it  
· Mirai tells eir mom about eir day at work and meeting Robin at the clinic  
· sie tells eir mom that sie things sie and Robin will be great friends  
· eir mom is glad to hear from eir daughter during her run  

after ending the chat, Mirai checks with eir social·assistant to see thoughts from eir aggregate social·community, which comprises family, friends, some professional groups, and the nuclear·fusion community of engineers and researchers  
· sie also allows content from a few social·agents into her social·timeline  
· sie sees an anniversary from eir aunt, some pictures at a beach from eir cousin, and a cute picture of Robin’s dog  
· bellow that, embedded in a recommendation from the **First·Logos** social·agent, sie sees an ad for beds on sale at a local furniture·store  
· Mirai uses First·Logos because it provides sie content that sie always finds pertinent to eir situation   
· Mirai smiles when sie thinks back to when eir mom told her that people used to get all kinds of ads from companies directly on their social·timelines  
· “how rude!” sie thinks  
· despite First·Logos’s recommendation, Mirai is not ready to make a direct connection with the furniture·store, but sie schedules a visit for the next day, after work  

later that evening, Mirai asks eir wall to take her to Amulet, which is a virtual·reality environment where all kinds of people from many corners of the world relate and interact with each other in real·time  
· people are depicted using avatars representing the real persons behind them  
· even though the environment is virtual, the people in it are real  
· Amulet is not a game but a place where people connect and socialize  
· people engage in activities that are possible only in a synthetic environment, such as flying from the heights of Mount Everest to the depths of the Mariana Trench in five minutes  
· Mirai enjoys eir time in Amulet, where sie spends about an hour each day before going to bed, no matter how tired sie might be, meeting people and learning about different cultures and experiences  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

***handsets serve as personal·identification·devices in the real·world and in virtual·worlds***  

Mirai and Robin go out one night to visit a trendy night club  
· at the door, Robin takes out eir handset, which asks sie to authenticate  
· after she does, the doorperson’s tablet displays eir picture, eir age, and a green check mark (because sie is over 21)  
· the doorperson verifies that Robin meets the criteria for entry and lets sie in  
· Mirai goes through the same procedure   
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

these are other perks of living in a future where technology advances society, people are respected by companies, and personal·information is safe:

  * you trust your devices because they are secure  
  * you trust the human·internet because it is safe and secure
  * you can have a complete, safe, and fulfilling digital·life without giving access to your personal·information to entities that you neither like nor trust  
  * you work with data and content, not apps
  * you have complete control over your devices; companies cannot dictate whether or how you repair or modify the devices you own
  * most software is trusted because it is open·source
  * a single company does not control your web·browsing experience  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## OUR PRESENT
> *it has become appallingly obvious that our technology has exceeded our humanity*  
> [**Albert Einstein**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein)  

&nbsp;

paranoia, mistrust, insecurity  
· this is what the internet of today gives us  

even though the internet comprises more than a few companies, most people think of it as a group of companies that offer free services for no apparent reason  
· in reality, these for·profit companies are enrichment machines that perform their fiduciary duties very well in the eyes of their principal beneficiaries, shareholders and owners, by obtaining, collecting, and using personal·information to fuel their operations, using methods of questionable legality, or tactics that are wholesale illegal, behind the backs of the people whose information is being peddled  

the internet is not a safe place for people because it was not designed to be safe; it was designed to be flexible and efficient, traits that internet companies have used and abused very effectively  
· the companies that perform their business activities on the internet operate on their own behalf to maximize control, efficiencies, and profits  
· they do not have society’s or humanity’s benefit at heart, despite their public statements to the contrary  
· their main goal is to grow their operations and enrich their owners and shareholders  
· this is not only legal, this is what for·profit entities must do in a [capitalist·society][capitalist·society]  

society does not benefit from the data silos powerful internet companies use to keep and increase their power and influence  
· companies like Facebook, Twitter, Amazon, and Google use their control over people’s data and their dominance over entire industries to pursue their agendas, while skirting laws and regulations  
· they do this because they know that people have few alternatives to the services they provide  
· to stay connected with family, acquaintances, and colleagues, people need to be on Facebook; to stay abreast of events involving major personalities and politicians, people have to be on Twitter; to have access to the myriad products sold online, people have to use Amazon; and to work efficiently with others on documents, spreadsheets, and presentations, people use Google Docs  
&nbsp;

> The robber baron era ended when we as a nation decided that some business tactics were out of line. And the question is whether we want to go back on that decision.  
> [Paul Krugman][Amazons_Monopsony_Is_Not_OK]  

&nbsp;

legal frameworks protecting personal·information are in their infancies  
· the [robber·barons][robber·barons] of the current era are taking advantage of this to stake their dominant positions by collecting and controlling as much personal·information as possible to enrich themselves  
· these companies do not use their dominant positions to benefit individuals or society  
· they leverage that dominance to grow their operations and generate as much profit as possible  
· and, while these companies have the resources to protect the personal information under their care, they do not protect it as they should  
· they are frequently breached by bad actors intent on stealing and using personal·information for 
nefarious objectives  
· in addition, these companies often just apologize and say that they have “fixed the issue,” and then a similar incident occurs some time later  

what follows is a list of news articles that demonstrate how much respect these companies have for the people they use to generate their increasing revenue and profits  
· before continuing, take a detour to learn about the [*surveillance·economy*][surveillance·economy]

### Facebook  
Facebook is a company started in a dorm·room with the slogan “move fast and break things”  
· it certainly has broken things, including the fabric of society and trust in businesses, very fast  

social·media is not inherently bad  
· this is how people relate and communicate  
· we have been doing this for millennia  
· but Facebook is doing social·media wrongly, *and* wrong

> Beyond the stark fact of legal compliance, this isn’t even a move that is likely to affect Facebook’s bottom line: **the company may actually stand to benefit from this, in terms of boosted profits and solidified market dominance.**

> Cutting off this program means advertisers will be serving ads to you based only on your Facebook data (plus any data the advertisers themselves have)—which means Facebook gets to keep all this money.

> Even though Facebook will soon stop using third-party data to serve us ads, the fact remains that it is collecting more data about us than ever.

#### [Why California’s Privacy Law Won’t Hurt Facebook or Google](https://www.wired.com/story/why-californias-privacy-law-wont-hurt-facebook-or-google)

> CCPA resembles a weaker form of Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which took effect in May. The California law requires companies to provide an opt-out to data sharing **(GDPR required an opt-in),** clear statements of what data is being collected or shared with third parties (as does the GDPR), and the right to delete data about yourself. The unique element, and the only one that the tech giants really pushed back on, was **a provision granting individuals the right to sue companies for violating their privacy.** The clause was effectively neutered when a political compromise limited the right to cases of egregious data loss or theft.

> Here’s why Facebook is better positioned for CCPA [California Consumer Protection Act], or GDPR [General Data Protection Regulation (Europe)]: It has a direct relationship with you. How does it know every device you use? Because the first thing you do when you buy a new device is log into Facebook, Instagram, or WhatsApp. How does it know your name, phone number, and address? Because you told it those things, or opted into sharing your location via the Facebook app.

#### [New analysis shows how Facebook and Google push users into sharing personal data](https://www.forbrukerradet.no/side/facebook-and-google-manipulate-users-into-sharing-personal-data)

> Facebook and Google steer us into sharing vast amounts of information about ourselves, through cunning design, privacy invasive defaults, and “take it or leave it”-choices, according to an analysis of the companies’ privacy updates.

> As the new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is implemented across Europe, users of digital services have been confronted with new privacy settings through numerous pop-up messages. Unfortunately, The Norwegian Consumer Councils just published analysis demonstrates that companies appear to have little intention of giving users actual choices.

> These companies manipulate us into sharing information about ourselves. This shows a **lack of respect for their users,** and are circumventing the notion of giving consumers control of their personal data, says Finn Myrstad, director of digital services in the Norwegian Consumer Council.

> In many cases, the services obscure the fact that **users have very few actual choices,** and that comprehensive data sharing is accepted just by using the service. The feeling of control may also convince users to share more information.

#### [Facebook discussed using people’s data as a bargaining chip, emails and court filings suggest](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2018/11/30/facebook-used-peoples-data-bargaining-chip-emails-court-filings-suggest/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.cbef04dc350c)

> In an ongoing federal court case against Facebook, the plaintiffs claim that the social media giant doled out people’s data secretly and selectively in exchange for advertising purchases or other concessions, even as others were cut off, ruining their businesses. The case was brought by one such company, Six4Three, which claims its business was destroyed in 2015 by Facebook’s actions.

> Using personal data as a bargaining chip — and giving special privileges to some companies while shutting out many others — appears to contradict Facebook’s repeated promises that it has never sold people’s data, as well as its claims that it restricted data to protect privacy and that its data partners were on an equal playing field. The case also raises questions about Facebook’s compliance with a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, which stipulated in 2011 that the social network could not give third-party developers access to user data that people thought they had kept private.

> In one of the exchanges from the filings, **Facebook employees discussed shutting down access “in one-go to all apps that don’t spend … at least $250k a year to maintain access to the data,”** according to the trove. The documents reference email exchanges regarding Facebook’s relations with several large commercial partners, including Lyft, Tinder, Amazon.com, Airbnb and the Royal Bank of Canada.

> Thousands of pages of court filings, which Facebook is fighting to keep sealed — including in an emergency hearing scheduled for Friday afternoon — illustrate the shrewd strategies the social network employed as it built its advertising empire. **The disclosure sheds light on allegations of anti-competitive behavior that could play into efforts by U.S. and European lawmakers to curb the power of technology giants.**  

> Since the Cambridge Analytica controversy highlighted Facebook data policies that **allowed a developer to inappropriately access the Facebook profiles of 87 million people,** lawmakers have repeatedly questioned Facebook about its relationships with data partners. **Chief executive Mark Zuckerberg told Congress in April that the company had cut off outsiders’ access to friends' data several years ago, but subsequent reports have exposed privileged relationships brokered by the company.**  

> For years, **Facebook actively courted developers** to build apps that encouraged people to spend more time on its desktop platform. **After the rise of smartphones, Facebook eventually became large enough that it didn’t need to rely on developers for engagement and ideas.**

> In 2014, **Facebook announced it was restricting developers’ access to the API,** citing privacy concerns from users who complained that their data was being shared with outsiders without their knowledge.

and developers keep falling for the ruse by companies like [Tweeter](https://marketingland.com/twitter-tightens-access-to-api-platform-restricts-number-of-daily-actions-an-app-can-perform-244937), [Facebook](https://techcrunch.com/2018/04/02/instagram-api-limit), and [Google](http://www.govtech.com/biz/Google-Maps-Restricts-its-API-Government-Collectively-Shrugs.html)

> What’s already been a rocky year after the Cambridge Analytica scandal, the company is scrambling to regain its users trust after another security incident exposed user data.

> The vulnerability was introduced on the site in July 2017, but Facebook didn’t know about it until this month, on September 16, 2018, when it spotted a spike in unusual activity. That means the hackers could have had access to user data for a long time, as Facebook is not sure right now when the attack began.

> In July 2017, **Facebook inadvertently introduced three vulnerabilities in its video uploader,** said Guy Rosen, Facebook’s vice president of product management, in a call with reporters. When using the “View As” feature to view your profile as someone else, the video uploader would occasionally appear when it shouldn’t display at all. When it appeared, it generated an access token using the person who the profile page was being viewed as. If that token was obtained, an attacker could log into the account of the other person.

#### [Facebook Moves to Block Ad Transparency Tools — Including Ours](https://www.propublica.org/article/facebook-blocks-ad-transparency-tools)

> “This is very concerning,” said Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va., who has co-sponsored the Honest Ads Act, which would require transparency on Facebook ads. “Investigative groups like ProPublica need access to this information in order to track and report on the opaque and frequently deceptive world of online advertising.”

> What it all adds up to, said Knight First Amendment Institute senior attorney Alex Abdo, is “we cannot trust Facebook to be the gatekeeper to the information the public needs about Facebook.”

> This is not the first time Facebook has changed its code in a way that has broken our tool. For example, all ads are supposed to contain the word “sponsored” as part of a mandatory disclosure, so users can distinguish between ads and their friends’ posts. Our tool recognized ads by searching for that word. Last year, Facebook added invisible letters to the HTML code of the site. So, to a computer, the word registered as “SpSonSsoSredS.” Later, it also added an invisible “Sponsored” disclosure to posts from your friends. Many of the participants in our project noticed the effects of this change because it caused some menus to pop open unexpectedly or the page to scroll to the top repeatedly. Nowadays, the disclosure says “SpSpSononSsosoSredredSSS.” Some of these changes were likely also intended to thwart ad blockers.

> Facebook remains far behind its competitors when it comes to affording its users due process.

> While we acknowledge that Facebook can and does shape its Community Standards according to its values, the company nevertheless has a responsibility to respect its users' expression to the best of its ability. Furthermore, civil society groups around the globe have criticized the way that Facebook’s Community Standards exhibit bias and are unevenly applied across different languages and cultural contexts. Offering a remedy mechanism, as well as more transparency, will go a long way toward supporting user expression.

#### [Facebook leaders ignored warnings, deflected blame as scandals mounted, report says](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebook-executives-reportedly-ignored-warnings-deflected-blame-amid-privacy-and-security-scandals)

> From Russian election meddling to a massive data privacy scandal, Facebook has faced a seemingly endless list of troubles. Now a new report suggests **the social network's leadership may be among its biggest challenges.**  

> Over the past three years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sheryl Sandberg ignored warnings, **deflected blame and were distracted by other projects as the social network lurched from crisis to crisis,** according to a 5,000-word report Wednesday by The New York Times. The paper, which interviewed more than 50 people for the story, painted an unflattering portrait of how the two executives managed the series of scandals, some of which eventually prompted Congress to ask both of them to testify.  

> “Bent on growth, the pair ignored warning signs and then sought to conceal them from public view," The Times wrote. "At critical moments over the last three years, **they were distracted by personal projects, and passed off security and policy decisions to subordinates, according to current and former executives.**”  

a company takes its cues from the top, in this case the top was focused on user·growth and profits (which is what for·profit companies are obliged to do)    
· Facebook’s management ignored warnings about serious problems with its platform  
· they were not focused on the privacy and protection of personal·information, and on how third·parties used the platform for nefarious purposes  
· then, they tried to hide their involvement (or lack thereof), stalled, and lied about their plans to solve 
the issues  
· **Facebook is an untrustworthy enterprise**

#### [Sheryl Sandberg: The Teens ‘Consented’ to Putting Facebook Spyware on Their Phones](https://gizmodo.com/sheryl-sandberg-the-teens-consented-to-putting-faceboo-1832218843)

> On Tuesday, news broke via TechCrunch that Facebook ran a sketchy “Research” program involving paid participants who downloaded an app onto their phones that was capable of monitoring virtually everything that they did—including in some cases teens as young as 13, who were recruited via social media ads that appeared designed to keep Facebook’s involvement low-profile. The app appeared to be a version of Facebook’s awful Onavo Protect VPN, the iOS version of which got yanked from Apple’s App Store last year for violating rules on data collection.

> “So I want to be clear what this is,” Sandberg told CNBC’s Julia Boorstin on Wednesday. “This is a Facebook Research app. It’s very clear to the people who participated. It’s completely opt-in. There is a rigorous consent flow and people are compensated. It’s a market research program.”

> “Now, that said, we know we have work to do to make sure **people’s data is protected,**” Sandberg added, repeating a thoroughly unconvincing line that has been rolled out so many times amid Facebook’s constant scandals that it has barreled into self-satire territory. “It’s your information. You put it on Facebook, you need to know what is happening. In this case the people who chose to participate in this program did.”

> As for whether the teenagers involved in the program “consented,” legal minors cannot sign contracts without parental or guardian consent. Facebook has insisted that all participants below the age of 18 submitted parental consent forms, but it would be impossible for Facebook to remotely verify that the teens just didn’t fill them out themselves without extra steps.

> BBC reporter Dave Lee tweeted that **he was able to sign up for Facebook’s Research program and told to download the app using a birthday in 2005,** all without being asked for any kind of parental consent form at all.

Facebook’s goal is to maximize profits using personal·data  
· and it obtains personal·data using any means necessary, including convincing teenagers to disclose everything they do on their phones

#### [Facebook’s troubles continue to grow: What you need to know](https://www.cnet.com/news/facebooks-terrible-year-just-got-worse-what-you-need-to-know)

> This week, Germany's antitrust regulator **ordered the world's largest social network to stop combining data from the Facebook accounts of its German users with information it collects about them from other sites unless they give their OK.** The Federal Cartel Office's order covers not only Facebook’s site, but Instagram, WhatsApp and other apps it own.

> The German order is yet another reminder -- as if more were needed -- that social network is piling up trouble almost as quickly as added users. The company, which turned 15 years old in February, is **trying to rebuild user trust,** which has eroded in the midst of data and privacy scandals. **It's also facing the wrath of lawmakers around the world because of the way its been used to spread misinformation and hate speech, as well as meddle in 
> elections.**    

> Facebook said **the data of 29 million people had been stolen, including names, email addresses and phone numbers.

> Male impotence, substance abuse, right-wing politics, left-wing politics, sexually transmitted diseases, cancer, mental health.

> Those are just a few of the advertising labels that Google’s adtech infrastructure routinely sticks to Internet users as **it watches and tracks what they do online in order to target them with behavioral ads.**  

> Intimate and highly sensitive inferences such as these are then **systematically broadcast and shared with what can be thousands of third party companies,** via the real-time ad auction broadcast process which powers the modern programmatic online advertising system. So essentially you’re looking at the rear-end reality of how creepy ads work.

> “There is no legal justification for such pervasive and invasive profiling and processing of personal data for profit,” the complaint asserts.

> “The industry facilitates this practice and does not put adequate safeguards in place to ensure the integrity of that personal (and special category) data. Further, individuals are unlikely to know that their personal data has been so disseminated and broadcast unless they are somehow able to make effective subject access requests to a vast array of companies. It is not clear whether those organisations have a record of compliance with such requests. **Without action by regulators, it is impossible to ensure industry-wide compliance with data protection regulations.**”

> Here’s a few more highly sensitive labels that are being attached to web users’ identities and shared with potentially thousands of bidding ad companies — in this case the labels are ones which the IAB uses: **Special needs kids, endocrine and metabolic diseases, birth control, infertility, diabetes, Islam, Judaism, disabled sports, bankruptcy.**  

> The group has also submitted v1 of the IAB’s taxonomy as evidence, and this list includes other disturbingly intimate categories — including a category for **‘incest/abuse support’.**  

> “Actors in this ecosystem are keen for the public to think they are dealing in anonymous, or at the very least non-sensitive data, but this simply isn’t the case. **Hugely detailed and invasive profiles are routinely and casually built and traded as part of today’s real-time bidding system, and this practice is treated though it’s a simple fact of life online. It isn’t: and it both needs to and can stop,” added Veale in a statement.**

> The program, known as Replica, offers planning agencies the ability to model an entire city’s patterns of movement. Like “SimCity,” Replica’s “user-friendly” tool deploys statistical simulations to give a comprehensive view of how, when, and where people travel in urban areas. It’s an appealing prospect for planners making critical decisions about transportation and land use. In recent months, transportation authorities in Kansas City, Portland, and the Chicago area have signed up to glean its insights. The only catch: **They’re not completely sure where the data is coming from.**

> These privacy concerns have been far from theoretical. **An Associated Press investigation showed that Google’s apps and website track people even after they have disabled the location history on their phones.** Quartz found that Google was tracking Android users by collecting the addresses of nearby cellphone towers even if all location services were turned off. The company has also been caught using its Street View vehicles to collect the Wi-Fi location data from phones and computers.  

> “We see a lot of companies erring on the side of collecting it and doing coarse de-identifications, even though, more than any other type of data, location data has been shown to be highly re-identifiable,” he added. **“It’s obvious what home people leave and return to every night and what office they stop at every day from 9 to 5 p.m.”** A landmark study uncovered the extent to which people could be re-identified from seemingly-anonymous data using just four time-stamped data points of where they’ve previously been.

> **A document from the Illinois Department of Transportation describes Replica’s data sources as “mobile carrier data, location data from third-party aggregators and Google location data, to generate travel data for a region.” This data sample, it adds, “is not limited to Android devices” and “is collected from individuals for months at a time, allowing for a complete picture of individual travel patterns.**” In Portland, documents filed with its city council state that the data is sourced from “Android Phones and Google apps.” Officials at the Portland Bureau of Transportation told Oregon Public Broadcasting that some of the sources of Sidewalk Lab’s mobile location data may also come from other sources, not yet known to them. Minutes from a regional transit planning meeting for Kansas City suggest that it’s possible for Replica “to get data on things like Uber & Lyft,” while a city PowerPoint states that the tool is “based off of Google data.”

> “Replica is a perfect example of **surveillance capitalism,** profiting from information collected from and about us as we use the products that have become a part of our lives,” said Brenda McPhail, director of the Canadian Civil Liberties Association’s Privacy, Technology, and Surveillance Project. **“We need to start asking, as a society, if we are going to continue to allow business models that are built around exploiting our information without meaningful consent.”**

> When reached for comment, an Amazon spokesperson told TechCrunch that the issue exposed names as well as email addresses. **“We have fixed the issue and informed customers who may have been impacted.” The company emailed all impacted users to be cautious.**  

what does that mean?  

> In response to a request for specifics, a spokesperson said the company had “nothing to add beyond our statement.” The company denies there was a data breach of its website of any of its systems, and says it’s fixed the issue, but dismissed our request for more info including the cause, scale and circumstances of the error.  

> **Amazon’s reticence here puts those impacted at greater risk.** Users don’t know which of Amazon’s sites was impacted, who their email address could have been exposed to, or any ballpark figure of the number of victims.

> A common tactic used by the IRA was to **create “local news” accounts for major US cities, seeding them with posts linking to local news outlets.** The accounts, such as “Atlanta Online,” “Baltimore Online,” “Baton Rouge Voice,” “Chicago Daily News,” and “Dallas Top News” would also include tweet-length news headlines with no link (such as “Obama draws sharp contrasts with ‘mean’ Republicans” and “Trump's immigration stance dividing GOP in Arizona again”).

> Gadde and Roth noted that Twitter expects these sorts of campaigns to continue and said that Twitter's Site Integrity team will **“continue to proactively combat nefarious attempts to undermine the integrity of Twitter, while partnering with civil society, government, our industry peers, and researchers to improve our collective understanding of coordinated attempts to interfere in the public conversation.”**  

Twitter’s inability to verify that users are real human·beings or legal·entities allowed criminal organizations like Russia’s Internet Research Agency to spread fake news and hate on its platform

an infrastructure that is based on real confirmable identities would not prevent individuals from posting fake and hateful content but would make it easier for people to identify the source of the content, and gauge by themselves whether it should be believed

The study will be presented at the Web Conference in San Francisco this May. “They’ve said they’re now taking this problem seriously and implementing a lot of countermeasures. The takeaway is that **these countermeasures didn’t have a substantial impact on these applications that are responsible for millions and millions of abusive tweets.**”

> "My teen found a major security flaw in Apple’s new iOS. He can listen in to your iPhone/iPad without your approval," Thompson wrote, “I have video. Submitted bug report to @AppleSupport...waiting to hear back to provide details. Scary stuff! #apple #bugreport @foxnews.”

> While Thompson tweeted at Apple on Jan. 20, she also sent a formal notice to the company on Jan. 25 alerting them of the bug. Meyer shares screenshots provided by the mother, including an email sent to Apple's product-security@apple.com email address that the company lists as a way for users to report issues to the company.

> In subsequent tweets, Thompson says that Apple wanted her to **register as a developer to submit the bug report,** which she did even though she is not “tech savvy.”

why would a regular user trying to report a serious problem with FaceTime to Apple have to register as a developer to file a bug?

> Apple released iOS 12.1.4 today to fix a major security flaw in FaceTime that allowed people to eavesdrop on iPhone users. The bug was originally reported to Apple by Michele Thompson after her 14-year-old son, Grant, discovered that you could add yourself to a Group FaceTime call and force recipients to answer immediately. Apple was initially slow to respond, but the company has now credited the discovery to Grant Thompson of Catalina Foothills High School.

that *is* good

> Either way, this is yet another DST bug for Apple. The company used to struggle with time-related bugs during the early days of iOS, causing alarms to fail across Europe, alarms simply not working on New Year’s Day, and the incorrect time being shown in the built-in calendar app.

> Microsoft deleted several Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) databases in Azure, **holding live customer information.** TDE databases dynamically encrypt the information they store, decrypting it when customers access it. Keeping the data encrypted at rest stops an intruder with access to the database from reading the information.

> This shows what can go wrong when cloud-based systems are interconnected and automated enough to allow cascading failures. **A software defect at a DNS provider indirectly led to the deletion of live customer information thanks to a lack of human intervention.**

> CenturyLink seems to be experiencing serial DNS problems lately. The company, which completed its $34bn acquisition of large network operator Level 3 in late 2017, also **suffered a DNS outage in December that reportedly affected emergency services, sparking an FCC investigation.**

Microsoft provides a service that encrypts data at rest  
· this is good for data·privacy and data·security  
· however, the infrastructure on which Microsoft bases its service does not provide effective protection, which results in data loss  
· Microsoft needs to ensure that all components that are part of its service provide effective and reliable data·protection, so that data is not lost thru system malfunctions

Vodafone is working closely with GSMA, banks and security experts on this issue.”** The GSMA is a trade group that represents mobile network operators.

if this is true, why has not Vodafone shared their approach with telecommunications companies?  
· or why do not other telecommunications companies use Vodafone’s countermeasures? pride?

> The fundamental issue with the SS7 network is that it **does not authenticate who sent a request.** So if someone gains access to the network—a government agency, a surveillance company, or a criminal—SS7 will treat their commands to reroute text messages or calls just as legitimately as anyone else’s. There are protections that can be put in place, such as SS7 firewalls, and ways to detect certain attacks, but room for exploitation remains.

> The bounty hunter sent the number to his own contact, who would track the phone. The contact responded with a screenshot of Google Maps, containing a blue circle indicating the phone’s current location, approximate to a few hundred metres.

> The bounty hunter did this all without deploying a hacking tool or having any previous knowledge of the phone’s whereabouts. Instead, **the tracking tool relies on real-time location data sold to bounty hunters that ultimately originated from the telcos themselves, including T-Mobile, AT&T, and Sprint,** a Motherboard investigation has found. These surveillance capabilities are sometimes sold through word-of-mouth networks.

> Although many users may be unaware of the practice, telecom companies in the United States sell access to their customers’ location data to other companies, called location aggregators, who then sell it to specific clients and industries. Last year, one location aggregator called LocationSmart faced harsh criticism for selling data that ultimately ended up in the hands of Securus, a company which provided phone tracking to low level enforcement without requiring a warrant. **LocationSmart also exposed the very data it was selling through a buggy website panel, meaning anyone could geolocate nearly any phone in the United States at a click of a mouse.**

> **Mobile phone networks sold location data to third parties under what it has since emerged was a very lax process that they didn't adequately audit. Those third parties then sold that data onto others, with the data eventually ending up in the hands of private citizens.**  

> Securus had built a huge database on inmates – and on the people that they called – that used A-GPS data and combined it with other information culled from elsewhere. In letters to the FCC, a group of inmate family member – called the Wright Petitioners – pointed out that **the location data in that database explicitly broke Section 222 because no one's consent had been obtained.**

As Typeform caters to organizations for online surveys and data collection, an increasing number of businesses and institutions have been notifying customers of the personal information that were stolen, such as **names, email addresses, scans of documents, Twitter login credentials, and Social Security Numbers, among others.**

> Typeform has informed their clientele of the incident and provided samples for notifying their respective individual customers. They did not disclose details on how attackers gained access and assured the public that the attackers did not steal any payment details or login credentials, though Singapore-based data platform Ocean Protocol differed. They posted an apology on their blog and confirmed that the hackers downloaded some participants' sensitive information such as ID numbers, wallet addresses, proofs of residence and accreditation.

In Australia and according to their data breach notification requirements, bakery chain Bakers Delight, the Tasmanian Electoral Commission, and the Australian Republican Movement also disclosed that they were affected by the breach. More companies are expected to make their announcements as they notify their respective customers and offer concessions for identity theft protection.

> Apps like Abercrombie & Fitch, Hotels.com and Singapore Airlines [...] These session replays let app developers record the screen and play them back to see how its users interacted with the app to figure out if something didn’t work or if there was an error. **Every tap, button push and keyboard entry is recorded — effectively screenshotted — and sent back to the app developers.**

> The App Analyst, a mobile expert who writes about his analyses of popular apps on his eponymous blog, recently found **Air Canada’s iPhone app wasn’t properly masking the session replays when they were sent, exposing passport numbers and credit card data in each replay session. Just weeks earlier, Air Canada said its app had a data breach, exposing 20,000 profiles.**

> Not every app was leaking masked data; **none of the apps we examined said they were recording a user’s screen — let alone sending them back to each company or directly to Glassbox’s cloud.**

> That could be a problem if any one of Glassbox’s customers aren’t properly masking data, he said in an email. “Since this data is often sent back to Glassbox servers **I wouldn’t be shocked if they have already had instances of them capturing sensitive banking information and passwords,” he said.**

> Expedia’s policy makes no mention of recording your screen, nor does Hotels.com’s policy. And in Air Canada’s case, we couldn’t spot a single line in its iOS terms and conditions or privacy policy that suggests **the iPhone app sends screen data back to the airline.** And in Singapore Airlines’ privacy policy, there’s no mention, either.

> **“I think users should take an active role in how they share their data, and the first step to this is having companies be forthright in sharing how they collect their users data and who they share it with,”** said The App Analyst.

some companies are collecting and sharing personal·information with random companies people do not know about  
· this means that, on the internet, people do not have control over their personal·information  
· companies who should be extremely careful with personal details such as names, credit card numbers (and their CVV codes), and passport numbers, are not auditing their software, vetting their business partners, and ensuring that personal·information is always encrypted while in transit and at rest  
· these companies are not using basic security methods to keep their clients’ data private and secure  

there is a part 2 to this story: [Apple tells app developers to disclose or remove screen recording code](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/07/apple-glassbox-apps)  
· it took TechCrunch’s shaming article, but Apple has addressed this serious problem of companies capturing and sharing personal·information without telling people what they are doing  

> Apple is telling app developers to remove or properly disclose their use of analytics code that allows them to record how a user interacts with their iPhone apps — or face removal from the app store, TechCrunch can confirm.

> **It follows an investigation by TechCrunch that revealed major companies, like Expedia, Hollister and Hotels.com, were using a third-party analytics tool to record every tap and swipe inside the app.** We found that none of the apps we tested asked the user for permission, and none of the companies said in their privacy policies that they were recording a user’s app activity. 

Apple is one of the most valuable companies in the world  
· it makes boatloads of money selling devices and providing services  
· but it cannot ensure that app developers do not capture and share personal·information, breaking its own rules  
· this is exactly why infrastructure that is public, completely secure, where personal·information is encrypted before being communicated and when it is stored, is necessary for people to trust that their information is not disclosed to parties they neither know nor approve of  
· thank you, [TechCrunch][TechCrunch] and your investigative team for bringing this issue to light

#### [Researcher Assaulted By A Vendor After Disclosing A Vulnerability](https://www.secjuice.com/security-researcher-assaulted-ice-atrient)

> Following a serious vulnerability disclosure affecting casinos globally, an executive of casino technology vendor Atrient has **assaulted the security researcher who disclosed the vulnerability at the ICE conference in London.** This is the story of a vulnerability disclosure gone bad, one involving the FBI, a vendor with a global customer base of casinos and a **severe security vulnerability which has gone unresolved for four months without being properly addressed.**

> **These kiosks and the back end server communicate the personal details of their users and send data like drivers license scans (used for enrollment), user home addresses and contact details, as well as details about user activity, unencrypted over publicly accessible internet. When the researcher discovered that the unauthenticated reward server was directly connected to the kiosks on the casino floor they realized that the API the kiosks used was wide open and extremely vulnerable to criminal abuse.**

> Because there is no SSL protection and because the API is wide open and vulnerable to abuse, **it is possible to identify kiosks by their Mac address and use the unsecured API to change details, track users and add credit to user accounts and even spin up a kiosk on a virtual machine in order to have your own personal kiosk at home.**

> The security researchers who first discovered this vulnerability, Dylan and Me9187, told me that the vulnerability was just the tip of the iceberg when it came to sloppy security practices at Atrient. **They saw casino WiFi network passwords stored in plaintext, user personal data stored in plaintext and no attempt to secure anything.**

> They even found Atrient's third party contractors (based in India) posting Atrient's source code on Github and asking stack overflow questions about it, an indicator which made it obvious to the researchers that **security was not being taken seriously.**

> For a company like Atrient with a global customer base and a record of talking about how secure their systems were, you would expect them to respond immediately. Unfortunately **Atrient completely ignored repeated emails to multiple executives and members of the Atrient team.**

> [the security researchers] clearly explained to Atrient how the risk of abuse was extremely high because there is no way to differentiate the legit calls from the malicious api calls in the Atrient back end system, leaving it wide open to malicious exploitation by criminals.

> I was not privy to this call, but I have been told by the researchers that **Jessie Gill promised them a bug bounty of $60,000 and asked them to keep the incident quiet until their lawyers could draw up an NDA and legal agreement for them to sign.**

> It became clear over four months that no legal paperwork or bug bounty was forthcoming and Atrient did not at any time ask the researchers to sign an NDA. **It also became clear to the researchers that Atrient had made no significant changes to their security policies or the security of their services in that time frame.** The security researchers were given the run around for over three months, during which time they were promised a bug bounty and that the vulnerability would be resolved.

> Almost four months after the initial disclosure to Atrient, the security researchers learned that the **Atrient CEO Sam Attisha** had big plans for the ICE Conference in London where the security researchers are based.  Sam Attisha had planned to speak at the conference about the **new facial recognition feature in their kiosks that scanned users faces, uploaded the biometric data to their servers, allowing casino customers to use their kiosks without swiping their membership cards.**

> This alarmed the researchers who quite rightly identified the facial scans as a serious privacy risk for the users, especially if the back end infrastructure was not properly secured, further compounding the existing security problems Atrient had.

> When one of the security researchers, Dylan Wheeler, approached COO Jessie Gill and introduced himself as the researcher who Jessie had been dealing with, **Jessie suddenly lunged at the researcher and violently grabbed him by his clothes on his chest before then tearing his attendee badge away from him, telling the researcher that he didn't need it anymore and that he would keep hold of it.**

this episode is nothing short of institutional negligence and incompetence  
· where was the security team?  
· what was Customer Service doing?  
· nobody at [Atrient](http://www.atrient.com/about/about-us) lifted a finger in light of the multiple reports by security researchers about the shoddy design and security vulnerabilities of the product major clients use to manage the personal·information of millions of casino goers  

the CEO and COO of Atrient show complete disregard for the security capabilities of the product they sell to casinos  
· when notified about problems with their product, they ignored, disrespected, deceived, and attacked the person who discovered the problems  
· these people should not be running a company that handles sensitive private·information

### fake content federation, temporary integrations

one of the benefits of **content·federation** is the ability to create content once and have it published in several platforms  
· but a humane feature is to be able to modify the original content and have the changes also reflected in other platforms  
· however, what we have with many internet companies is read·only copies of the original content we create under what purports to be a federated model  
· this model is also inherently inefficient because it relies on copies of content instead of having a single source of content, which wastes storage space and network bandwidth  

some companies offer **integrations** to their platforms  
· platforms sometimes offer an **application·programming·interface** (API) that allows companies to write apps that access the platform directly  
· this creates an ecosystem that benefits both the platform, small companies and startups, and individuals by offering options when it comes to authoring and publishing content  
· this is how apps like TweetDeck, and TweetBot provided people with innovative and helpful ways to participate in the Twitter ecosystem, and helped the ecosystem grow  
· but Twitter, after a period of growth where it got the number of users it wanted to convince possible investors and venture·capitalists to invest in it—and then go public—limit or revoke access to the interface, leaving the companies that took risks and based their business in the Twitter ecosystem, in the lurch  
· companies like Medium, Twitter, and Facebook have engaged in such inhumane (for individuals) and dishonorable (for companies) behavior  

read·only copies of content and integrations that companies can revoke at a whim are neither humane nor honorable  
&nbsp;

#### [Ending our Medium integration](https://write.as/blog/ending-our-medium-integration)

> Our original goal in supporting the Medium API was to **create more bridges between different web silos.** That was part of the promise of Medium back when it started, after all — a network of blogs, instead of individual islands. When they opened their API, we knew that would be the perfect chance to help writers connect with more readers.

> We trusted that Medium might not do what many VC-funded platforms have done before: open an API, attract developers and users, grow, then shut it all down. Unfortunately, that's exactly what they did. And unlike their previous pivots, they didn't even give the courtesy of a small heads-up.

**NOTE:** i could not confirm whether [Medium][Medium] actually revoked access to its API    
· when i checked in February of 2019, it seemed that the API was still available for use by third·parties  
· but it is clear that the content that third·parties can publish in Medium through its API is a copy of whatever content that third·party is publishing  
· it is not “live content”  
· updating the original content does not update Medium’s version of that content  
· it would be more humane to offer a true “write·once, publish everywhere” approach at the network level instead of read·only content duplicates that do not reflect edits to the original content  
&nbsp;


#### [Medium’s latest pivot leaves independent media in the lurch](https://techcrunch.com/2018/05/10/mediums-latest-pivot-leaves-some-independent-media-in-the-lurch)

> Medium  has abruptly pulled a feature that allowed publishers to operate paywalls on its platform, leaving some independent media scrambling for alternative options to maintain a crucial source of revenue.

> The company this week shuttered a two-year program that let media run paid subscription services on its site. Nieman Lab reports that Medium contacted its 21 remaining subscription publishing partners at the end of April to give them **a week’s notice on the shutdown.** Although Medium said it offered to extend the deadline for those who needed more time.

> A lot can happen in a week, but it’s not a lot of time when it comes to rejigging business models — particularly in the media industry where revenue is sacred and direct relationships with readers are savored.

Medium really did not behave honorably  
· it offered a feature on which other businesses relied to receive revenue from their subscribers, and removed that feature abruptly  
· entities should not have to rely on other entities to get access to human·beings  
· all commercial entities should be able to have a *direct connection* with the entities (human or otherwise) with whom they want to relate  
· a company’s pivots should have no effect other companies business relationships

## OUR DIGITAL LIFE

> *i spent my time reconnecting loved ones, doing the work that governments were afraid to do*  
> [**Donny**](https://youtu.be/iFRT5noguxw "YouTube: Donny The Drone")  

&nbsp;

we have the technology, the hardware, and the software, to escape the shackles of greed, negligence, incompetence, and criminality on the internet  
· the tools and resources to take power from the internet’s behemoths are in our hands, laps, and desks  
· the tools are our devices, powered with open·source·software  
· the resources comprise our personal·information and our dedication to a better, more humane world   
· by aggregating our personal·information and managing it with powerful, reliable, and secure, open·source·software, we can take power away from the Facebooks, the Twitters, the Amazons, and the Googles of the world, and give it to ourselves, to society, to humanity  
· with that power we can speed up the advent of a future on which human advancement is pursued with bigger fervor than exponential growth, increasing revenues, and ever larger quarterly profits  

regulation is one way to take power from the internet behemoths  
· breaking up Facebook and Amazon could bring change, and is an option that should be explored  
· but that takes too long  
· a better option is for individuals, for businesses, for societies, and for humanity to make these powerful companies less powerful, to reduce their influence by increasing the *people’s power*  

public, humane platforms dedicated to improving the digital lives of human·beings and humanity, in lieu of any [profit·motive][profit·motive], can be effective at moving the power that the internet behemoths have amassed using questionable tactics to the rightful beneficiaries of that power: the people whose data has fueled that growth   
· these platforms, operating transparently, responsibly, professionally, and securely, will have the goal of benefiting people first, not the bank accounts of greedy entities    

the **Human·Internet Initiative** aims at providing an environment where such platforms can grow, on which everybody (human·beings and other entities) can connect, relate, and interact with each other privately and securely, engendering a feeling of honor, fairness, and safety not present in the internet of today

### vision

> [*at the core of humanity is empathy and connection*](https://youtu.be/VxuWIXdYYyQ "YouTube: Technology Is Reinventing Humanity")  
> [**Jordan Nguyen**][Jordan_Nguyen]  
> 
&nbsp;

the alternative to the current internet dominance of modern·day robber·barons is the **human·internet**  
· the main goal of the human·internet is to keep individuals, groups, communities, societies, and humanity top of mind when it comes to who benefits from technological advancement  

all entities—from big corporations to small startups—should have complete access to the personal·information to which individuals grant them access  
· a person’s general personal·information, such as addresses, phone numbers, connections, groups, and communities, should be available only to authorized·entities, the entities to whom that person grants access  
· people should not have to maintain personal·information at multiple locations, with multiple entities; updating an email or home address should be done only once, with all authorized parties having access to the updated details automatically  
· people have ultimate control over which entities have access to their personal·information  
· entities whom the person does not know will not have access to that person’s information  
· entities with access to a person’s information loose that access when the person deauthorizes them to access eir information  
· the human·internet effectively switches the tables on the internet’s robber·barons  

individuals—thru the power they exercise by pooling their personal·information on a single, public platform—should be able to offer the services that powerful internet companies such as Facebook and Twitter offer their customers  
· individuals deserve to have a powerful entity who advocates for them and represents their interests primarily, and not the revenue-maximizing motives of for·profit entities  
· for example, similar to Facebook, a common store of personal information that is controlled by people could offer ad companies the targeting capabilities that Facebook offers, but in ways that are more respectful of people’s right for privacy  
· because people would be invested in their platform’s continued success, they would be motivated to store information on the platform that is more valuable than the information Facebook collects through automated—and sometimes questionable—means such as the person’s location, and the operations the person performs on eir devices (yes, Facebook collects that, check its [data·policy](https://www.facebook.com/policy.php))  
· people could share information about events that are valuable to them, enriching those events with notes, messages, documents, and photos that provide a more complete picture of the event’s meaning in their lives  
· people would make such intimate details available on the platform because they trust that the information will be used only on their behalf, and that it will not land on the wrong hands  

a public, humane, responsible, and secure environment would be an effective foundation for human-centric services that are free to human beings  
· these include identity, social, connection, communication, community, content·authorship, and content·exploration services  
· they represent essential digital functionality that must be available to every human being at no cost, and without sacrificing their privacy, the security of their data, and their personal safety thru the digital·interactions they perform with other entities  

companies could find paying for access to data in public and humane platforms more cost·effective that obtaining and maintaining personal·information themselves  
· several societies, including Europe, Japan, and California, have passed laws and regulations that give individuals ways to control how companies can use, share, and sell their personal information, among other preferences  
· companies have adapted to this changing environment in several ways, including modifying their systems, and ceasing operations  
· there are some companies who find it difficult to adapt, and use the services of third·parties to help them comply with the new rules  
· a platform that can make it easy for companies to access personal information while complying with regulations such as General Data Protection Regulation (Europe) and the California Consumer Data Protection Act could be of value to small companies and startups  

these are some of the principles that reflect the human·internet vision:  

* saying no to siloed data and content
* making pivots irrelevant
* making personal·information truly personal not a commodity
* operating openly and transparently
* providing equal access to personal·information to entities big and small
* advancing human–machine interaction  
* educating people, nonprofits, and for·profit entities on the benefits of a public, secure, and responsible internet

### changing the world

> [*impossible magic*](https://youtu.be/zVsHzS70krg "YouTube: Is there a limit to technological progress?")  
> [**Clément Vidal**][Clement_Vidal]  

&nbsp;

Facebook is the premier social·network company, a position it has earned through innovation, imitation, acquisition, and hard work  
· but as it has gained power and influence, Facebook has behaved badly  
· it has shared personal·information with entities the owners of that information did not know and about whom they were not informed in any practical way  
· by having billions of people in its network and providing highly·specific ways to target them with ads, Facebook makes large amounts of money  
· unfortunately, the company does not share that success with the users whose data it uses to generate revenue  
· instead, it invests in new ways to lure people into providing it with more of their personal·information  
· Facebook itself and its shareholders are the sole beneficiaries of the efficiencies and profits its products provide to its main customers, the ad companies  
· the company does not help improve the lives of its *data·cows*   

Amazon is another example of wanton market and industry dominance  
· through aggressive pricing, and questionable business tactics (such as delisting a book publisher’s books from its online store during contract negotiations), Amazon has grown to dominate the online·retail business (among other industries)  
· Amazon uses its position of dominance to act arrogantly and irresponsibly with personal·information, not to mention the bullying of “business partners”   
· even though it has under its control the computing resources that power industries, armies, and countries, it does not use the appropriate resources to avoid leaking personal·information as a result of preventable errors, or to protect people’s private voice recordings with sound engineering practices   

in eir well-researched [paper][Amazons_Antitrust_Paradox], **Lina M. Khan** states:
> there are two approaches for addressing the power of dominant platforms:  
> (1) **limiting their dominance** through restoring traditional antitrust and competition policy principles and  
> (2) **regulating their dominance** by applying common carrier obligations and duties  

there is a third approach: a public, federated environment that nurtures platforms whose principal purpose is to help human beings to connect, relate, communicate, share, learn, transact, and live humanely, respectfully, 
and honorably  
· this would be a great check on and an alternative to Facebook, Amazon, and similar companies who use their size, dominance, and control over personal·information to inflict harm to individuals and society, to enrich themselves  
&nbsp;

profit-seeking entities usually pursue only projects and initiatives with the most growth or profit potential  
· projects that could be beneficial to society but fail to produce the required upside are often abandoned  
· entities who seek to benefit individuals and society efficiently, but without the need to produce huge profits, could be an avenue through which humanity can develop and nurture projects that are not influenced by the business interests of entities whose main goal is to produce profits for their owners and shareholders  

transportation businesses do not build bespoke highways between their customers’ locations  
· they hire the best drivers they can get, and put them in the best trucks they can afford, to deliver their cargo safely and on time  
· but the highways are built to be safe and reliable by people we trust to make them that way, [highway·engineers][highway·engineering]  
· truck drivers do not build the highways on which they do their work  
· but they know their trucks, they operate them so that they perform efficiently and safely, they learn everything about them so that they can tell when something is wrong  
· they also know what rules they must follow to drive on highways, they know the signs, and how to merge in and out of traffic, among other things  
· knowing how to operate what is under their control (their trucks), and how to interact with things that are not under their control (traffic), is how truck drivers provide the best overall service and earn good reputations by taking cargo between origin and destination locations on time  

the **human·internet**, like a highway system is to a truck driver, would offer a federated and distributed environment that entities who work with personal·information could use to provide their services  
· this humane environment, would comprise several humane platforms that offer storage, social, community, and professional services  
· with people sharing their personal·information thru privacy·focused, secure platforms, companies would compete based on merit, not by holding personal·information hostage  
· they would offer *aggregated·services* that provide compelling experiences  
· people, free to move seamlessly between aggregated·service·providers, choose the ones that best satisfy their needs and wants, not the one that has the most users, or where their data used to live    
· this is how *true competition* on the internet looks like   
 
the human·internet could also be a great vehicle through which the power the internet behemoths have can be slowly transferred to the people whose data has fueled the success of such entities  
· this approach would be more effective than laws, regulations, and antitrust enforcement actions could ever be  
&nbsp;

Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Amazon will not lose their superpowers because of the humane platforms in the human·internet overnight  
· but as small companies and startups adopt it out of convenience, people will slowly see the benefits of a common, public store of personal·information that is free from the shackles of internet robber·barons  
· they will see how great the *hyperweb* is, with smart·content that provides a navigation experience that satisfies their curiosity and their inner explorer  
· they will witness the beauty and practicality of a single store for their data, one that companies cannot access without their consent  
· only companies that show respect for personal·information, and provide first·class service will be granted access to this valuable resource by its owners  
· slowly, people will realize and wield their own superpowers  
&nbsp;

one of the humane platforms of the human·internet is **Peoples**, operated by **Peoples·Foundation**  
· the Peoples platform aims to be the alternative to Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, and Microsoft that people deserve  
· this platform, funded by individuals and humanistic entities, could be the open, humane, respectful, and secure platform that people need for them to fulfill their needs, and realize their dreams, without the corrupting influence of the profit·motive  
· for·profit entities that are members of Peoples·Foundation can work individually or together to propose new technologies that they think may satisfy the needs of people; many advancements start with the profit·motive behind them  
· however, the only projects that make it into the Peoples platform are the ones that the [Peoples·Foundation](../internet_plan/internet_plan.html/#peoplesfoundation) approves through the voice of each of its members    
· and those projects will be adapted to fit the rest of the foundation’s digital·infrastructure  
· no technology, data type, or basic algorithm, will be the sole domain of one company  
· everything related to storing, retrieving, and presenting data and content belongs to the people    

the main target audience of the Peoples platform are nontechnical Facebook, and Twitter users  
· however, these people’s continued loyalty to these platforms despite their multiple privacy violations and insincere apologies make it extremely difficult to convince them that their chosen platforms are not good for them (people used to prefer smartphones with [physical·keyboards](https://www.pcworld.com/article/3092184/mobile/rip-the-blackberry-classic-and-its-iconic-keyboard-is-dead.html))  
· therefore, we must target individuals that are more open to new, better experiences, especially when it comes to authoring and sharing content: college students, and university researchers  
· they would be more amenable to try out a platform that offers more humane content-authoring and content-navigation interactions  
· after a number of students and researchers find the platform useful, we could focus on larger audiences  

another target audience are software engineers, and open source practitioners and enthusiasts  
· these people can be part of the community of professionals that takes the platform forward, guided by the needs and wishes of its human users  
&nbsp;

there are other platforms that could be part of the human·internet  
· projects like [MesInfos][MesInfos] share some of the human·internet’s goals and values  
· a group of similar projects could provide a flexible, global, multifaceted alternative to the internet cabal  
· their existence can both provide alternatives to people and motivate the internet giants to change their ways and become the change agents they purport to be but have failed to become  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;


### products

> [*technology is the defining factor of our society*](https://youtu.be/4uo1FlcQENk "YouTube: The future of technology and Humanity")  
> [**Gerd Leonhard**][Gerd_Leonard]  

&nbsp;

the Peoples platform comprises several products, including an operating·system, software components to manage data and content, and interact with users, and cloud·software to manage the storage or personal·information  

the main products that realize the vision for the human·internet are:  

  * **Peoples·OS:** a privacy and security focused operating system, based on proven, secure, and reliable technologies     
  · it would be based on the open-source [TrueOS][TrueOS] operating system, which is based on [FreeBSD][FreeBSD], a long-lived secure and reliable operating system, and [OpenZFS][OpenZFS], which the computing industry deems as the best file system and volume manager available  

  * **system·supervisor:** a software·agent running on Peoples·OS that manages files and storage for the user, relieving the user from having to manipulate files, folders, and apps, to perform tasks and manipulate data and content  
  · the user interacts with the supervisor through adaptive user·interfaces (text, graphics, voice, or a combination of them) that allow the user to focus on the task at hand, while the supervisor (with the help of *task·assistants*) performs operations that are repetitive, boring, or that a computing device can perform more efficiently than an human can

  * **task·assistants:** software components that replace apps  
  · this type of software interacts with users in the most convenient and efficient way, depending on the task, context, data, and the user’s current environment and situation (for example, sitting at a desk or talking with a patient)  
  · for example, a writing·assistant would help authors produce content annotated with context that makes it easy to query and navigate; such context may include keywords, subject matter, term definitions, and source material  
  · a browsing·assistant would help people navigate the **hyperweb** (linked content produced by people using a writing·assistant) using an interaction model that follows [Ted Nelson’s][Ted_Nelson] vision for reading and navigating interconnected documents  

  * **personal·identification·devices:** these are devices such as phones and tablets that, with special software, people can use to authenticate themselves to others, after presenting themselves to a notary·public that attests to the person’s identity  
  · these devices contain a secure·enclave (also known as secure·element) to generate private·keys and perform encryption and decryption operations, and biometric capabilities, including fingerprint and facial recognition  

  * **Peoples·Cloud:** distributed, private, and secure storage for personal data and content  
  · this is where people’s personal·information is stored securely using the [**InterPlatetary File System** (IPFS)][IPFS]  
  · companies would be able to access the personal·information of people who authorize them    
  · the companies would pay Peoples·Foundation for access to Peoples·Cloud, which would offer access to personal·information as well as compute·services
