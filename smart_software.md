# Smarter Software
people work with data and content, not directly with files  
· we organize data and content in groups and categories, depending on the task we are performing and the context under which we are performing it  
· apps are an increasingly archaic form of software that is being slowly replaced by complex systems that learn and interact with other systems  

our devices—or more accurately, the software on our devices—must evolve to effectively protect and secure our data and the content we capture and produce, provide ways to dynamically classify and organize that information, and facilitate the interaction of smart software that helps us locate the appropriate information and perform tasks and carry out operations that it can execute more efficiently than we can  

**Peoples•OS** is the robust, secure, reliable, and humanistic operating·system that brings us closer to our personal·information by removing barriers and smoothing out our interactions with our data and content  
&nbsp;

## delivering effective and pleasant digital experiences
driving the first mass·market automobiles was a [truly involved endeavor](https://youtu.be/gTL5z32pqtU "YouTube: Model T Driving Instructions")  
· as time goes on, our “driving” experience becomes less focused on the intricate workings of the systems that make the car go and more on, well, anything other than [driving](https://youtu.be/WBkgs4u5tW0 "YouTube: Riding a Waymo self-driving taxi")  

just like corporations are working hard and making huge investments to teach car how to navigate roads and highways to get people from place to place, Peoples•OS will allow our devices to use files, file·systems, and volume·managers to help us accomplish objectives and perform tasks with our data and content  

Peoples•OS will not offer apps  
· Peoples•OS will provide specialized *task·assistants* (writing·assistants, drawing·assistants, scheduling·assistants, recording·assistants) that help users manage content and data in their purest forms  
· just like you will not have to worry about the layout of roads, speed limits, and traffic, you will not have to worry about where to store a picture you just took so that you can include it in the event·invitation you are 
authoring  
· the media·assistant, together with the writing·assistant, will provide that picture as one of the main suggestions when you perform the import operation on the document  

Peoples•OS is the open·source operating·system aimed primarily at nongeeks, “regular people” who are not interested in the intricacies of their devices’ operating·system and architecture  
· these users just want to get things done as fast and simply as possible  
· removing the need to handle files and file·systems, and the need to interact with apps is the first step in providing individuals software they can trust  
· common data formats and storage will benefit both people and corporations who will enjoy access to richer, more interconnected data while keeping that data private and secure  

this approach not only brings people together, but also brings companies together behind the humanistic goal of moving society forward by ensuring that individuals can become the best of themselves through technology

## redesigning people’s interactions with software
there are aspects of being human that should not be under the complete control of one or even a few entities  
· you have a social life full of *thoughts*, not tweets  
· you *communicate* with people, you do not dial, [Skype][Skype], or [FaceTime][FaceTime]    
· you *write* documents, not [Google Docs][GoogleDocs] or [Microsoft Office][MicrosoftOffice] documents   

there are many apps you can use to perform each of those tasks  
· sometimes you can work with the same content on more than one app  
· but other times you are forced into a proprietary format  
· each app offers a distinctive user experience, with advantages and disadvantages  
· sometimes those differences are helpful
· but most of the time they are an annoyance  
· when it comes to the essential, general content and data you manipulate on a daily basis, multiple apps, multiple interfaces, and multiple formats do not provide a pleasant digital experience  

Peoples•OS and *task·assistants* represent a new digital experience, more attuned to your capabilities, your curiosity, and your humanity  
&nbsp;

a **task·assistant** is the app replacement that brings you the data, content, and operations you need to perform the tasks you need complete to accomplish your objectives  
· assistants do not have a fixed user interface because the interface you work with is created for the task at hand  
· you do not have to decide *how* to do something  
· all you need to do is decide *what* to do, and the software—leveraging the capabilities of your device—creates the appropriate interface for the task, your context, and your environment (sitting at a desk, speaking with a patient, riding a bicycle)  

an assistant *assists* you while you perform your task by taking care of the boring, repetitive, and error·prone operations, freeing you to use your human faculties, insight, and curiosity in high·level activities  
· guided by your device’s *device·administrator*, assistants focus on the best way of performing a task or operation using past lessons, knowledge, and cooperation  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## providing a smart, trusted device administrator
devices running Peoples•OS are managed by an **automated·device·administrator**, which is a software agent tasked with looking after the user’s data and content, ensuring that it is private (encrypted), and protected against malfunctions, unauthorized access, or tampering (survives malfunctioning storage, hacking attacks by [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware), and user mistakes)  
· the administrator also manages task·assistants, and downloads or updates assistants as required  

the administrator relieves users from having to manage files and apps  
· users interact with the administrator interface to perform tasks  
· the administrator then calls on the appropriate assistants to perform the operations each task entails, on the appropriate data or content  

the administrator is robust, secure software that runs on a device using reliable subsystems such as [OpenZFS] to store and protect the user’s data  
· the administrator is like a smart and knowledgeable librarian who dutifully and quietly does eir job, while the user  enjoys being able to instantly access any piece of content sie wants without worrying about its location in the file·system or the app that can open it  
· devices running Peoples•OS will have standard, open·source task·assistants that can open any human·internet content  
· for·profit entities can develop and make available assistants, but they must make the specifications and source·code for those assistants available for public inspection  

the administrator orchestrates the operations of the assistants working on the device, ensuring that those tasks are completed timely and correctly  
· when things go wrong, the administrator attempts to correct the situation using local knowledge and, if available, knowledge from [**Peoples•Cloud**](https://ernestbruce.tumblr.com/post/181379869080/a-plan-for-a-private-safe-and-secure-internet)  
· if it cannot correct the problem after performing standard troubleshooting operations, the administrator reports the issue to the user  
&nbsp;

the administrator is like an automated [type 2 hypervisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEk0CKoeUnA "YouTube: Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors")  
· it facilitates the operation and cooperation of task·assistants  
· in turn, task·assistants are like virtual·machines that operate securely under the watchful eye of 
the administrator  

the administrator can also educate the user on the capabilities of the device, either by walking the user through a tutorial or by answering user inquiries  
· in addition, the administrator can provide a detailed log of all activity in the device, including the decisions it has made on behalf of the user  
&nbsp;

## building on top of reliable, secure, resilient infrastructure
a secure, reliable operating·system must be based on proven technology whose developers have shown a commitment to excellence, correctness, and security  
· to ensure the a highly collaborative and flexible development ecosystem, an important requirement for all components of the operating·system is that they be free·and·open·source·software (FOSS) under a 
[permissive·license][permissive·license]  

these are some of the technologies and products that fit these requirements:

  * [**OpenZFS**][OpenZFS]  
    · this is the premier file·system and volume·manager there is  
    · it offers data safety and durability  
    · its ability to create space·efficient snapshots means that users can have confidence that their data is safe even from their own actions  
    · snapshots also facilitate recovery of data made unavailable through ransomware attacks  
    · because OpenZFS stores and manages data across several drives, data can survive the malfunction or failure of one or more of those drives (depending on how made drives are available)  
    · this means, though, that devices have to have at least three identical drives to guarantee data safety  

  * [**FreeBSD**][FreeBSD]  
    · this free·and·open·source operating·system offers the security and performance that people expect to experience on their devices  
    · it has a vibrant developer community, guided by a group of committed, professional individuals, working together with the goal of developing a solid product  
    · the quality of FreeBSD is palpable in every aspect, including its reputation as a leader in innovation, performance, and reliability; its vast community of developers and contributors; and its documentation  

  * [**OpenBSD**][OpenBSD]  
    · this operating·system has a reputation for being the most secure operating·system available today  
    · its developers are dedicated to providing the most secure and correct code possible, and to introducing or implementing security features such as [**IPSec**][IPSec], [**OpenSSH**][OpenSSH], and [**ASLR**][ASLR]  
    · however, it does not provide the first·class OpenZFS integration that FreeBSD offers  

  * [**TrueOS**][TrueOS]
    · this operating·system is based on FreeBSD, and it adds a further commitment to innovation, data safety, security, and privacy  
    · it also serves as an early adopter and testing·bed for unreleased FreeBSD technologies  
    · in this sense, TrueOS both gains new technology from FreeBSD, and contributes tested code back to it  
    · development is completely open through [**GitHub**][GitHub]  
    · this is a good base on which to build Peoples•OS  

  * [**InterPlatetary File System**][IPFS] (IPFS)  
    · IPFS is a network·level file·system that provides global data persistence and ubiquity  
    · this distributed file·system provides encryption functionality that makes data retrieval impossible without the decryption key  
    · this file·system provides inherent snapshots; data is never lost  
    · its distributed nature prevents [**distriuted·denial·of·service**][DDoS] (DDoS) attacks because data is replicate across a number of computers (network nodes)  
    · it also has the ability to store past versions of data, making it easy to access and analyze historical data  
    · this open·source project provides the base upon which data privacy and security can be implemented at a global scale, the basis of a *new* internet  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## replacing apps with task·assistants
a task·assistant is more than an app  
· it is an entire operating·system using its resources to carry out particular tasks  
· it can comprise a set of components (programs and services) used to perform its function  
· it may also contain knowledge and related data to use in its operations
· however, this data has nothing to do with any person  
· all data and content that pertains to the user resides on the person’s common data store on the person’s device  

assistants are highly capable software systems  
· they are written by experienced software scientists and engineers with extensive knowledge of the system that makes up the assistant  
· they are correct, robust, reliable, and secure  
· the people involved in their development include software professionals, human–machine interaction experts, and data scientists  
· just like new neurosurgeons do not operate on a brain the dya after they graduate, newly minted programmers do not write assistants unsupervised  
· like writing airliner software, developing assistants involves a team of experts, rigurous testing, and onerous quality·assurance processes  

assistants run on Peoples•OS as jailed or virtualized environments  
· this gives their implementers a lot of flexibility  
· but they also have limited access to the host’s resources and user data (all access is mediated by the automated·administrator)

## interfacing with the human·internet
while having control over our personal data in our devices is great, we are a social species that communicates, collaborates, and relates to other humans on the internet  
· sadly, internet companies have larlely let down humanity with their business practices, data misuse, negligence, and criminality  
· therefore, we must extent the Peoples•OS strong data privacy and protection capabilities to a new internet, the human·internet
