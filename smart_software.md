people work with data and content, not directly with files  
· we organize data and content in groups and categories, depending on the task we are performing and the context under which we are performing it  
· apps are an increasingly archaic form of software that is being slowly replaced by complex systems that learn and interact with other systems  

our devices—or more accurately, the software on our devices—must evolve to effectively protect and secure our data and the content we capture and produce, provide ways to dynamically classify and organize that information, and facilitate the interaction of smart software that helps us locate the appropriate information and perform tasks and carry out operations that it can execute more efficiently than we can  

**Peoples•OS** is the robust, secure, reliable, and humanistic operating·system that brings us closer to our personal·information by removing barriers and smoothing out our interactions with our data and content

#delivering effective and pleasant digital experiences
driving the first mass·market automobiles was a [truly involved endeavor](https://youtu.be/gTL5z32pqtU "YouTube: Model T Driving Instructions")  
· as time goes on, our “driving” experience becomes less focused on the intricate workings of the systems that make the car go and more on, well, anything other than [driving](https://youtu.be/WBkgs4u5tW0 "YouTube: Riding a Waymo self-driving taxi")  

just like corporations are working hard and making huge investments to teach car how to navigate roads and highways to get people from place to place, Peoples•OS will allow our devices to use files, file·systems, and volume·managers to help us accomplish objectives and perform tasks with our data and content  

Peoples•OS will not offer apps  
· Peoples•OS will provide specialized task·assistants (writing·assistants, drawing·assistants, scheduling·assistants, recording·assistants) that help users manage content and data in their purest forms  
· just like you will not have to worry about the layout of roads, speed limits, and traffic, you will not have to worry about where to store a picture you just took so that you can include it in the event·invitation you are 
authoring  
· the media·assistant, together with the writing·assistant, will provide that picture as one of the main suggestions when you perform the import operation on the document  

Peoples•OS is the open·source operating·system aimed primarily at nongeeks, “regular people” who are not interested in the intricacies of their devices’ operating·system and architecture  
· these users just want to get things done as fast and simply as possible  
· removing the need to handle files and file·systems, and the need to interact with apps is the first step in providing individuals software they can trust  
· common data formats and storage will benefit both people and corporations who will enjoy access to richer, more interconnected data while keeping that data private and secure  

this approach not only brings people together, but also brings companies together behind the humanistic goal of moving society forward by ensuring that individuals can become the best of themselves through technology

#redesigning people’s interactions with software#
there are aspects of being human that should not be under the complete control of one or even a few entities  
· you have a social life full of *thoughts*, not tweets  
· you *communicate* with people, you do not dial, [Skype][Skype], or [FaceTime][FaceTime]    
· you *write* documents, not [Google Docs][GoogleDocs] or [Microsoft Office][MicrosoftOffice] documents   

there are many apps you can use to perform each of those tasks  
· sometimes you can work with the same content on more than one app  
· but other times you are forced into a proprietary format  
· each app offers a distinctive user experience, with advantages and disadvantages  
· sometimes those differences are helpful
· but most of the time they are an annoyance  
· when it comes to the essential, general content and data you manipulate on a daily basis, multiple apps, multiple interfaces, and multiple formats do not provide a pleasant digital experience  

Peoples•OS and *task·assistants* represent a new digital experience, more attuned to your capabilities, your curiosity, and your humanity  
&nbsp;

a **task·assistant** is the app replacement that brings you the data, content, and operations you need to perform the tasks you need complete to accomplish your objectives  
· assistants do not have a fixed user interface because the interface you work with is created for the task at hand  
· you do not have to decide *how* to do something  
· all you need to do is decide *what* to do, and the software—leveraging the capabilities of your device—creates the appropriate interface for the task, your context, and your environment (sitting at a desk, speaking with a patient, riding a bicycle)  

an assistant *assists* you while you perform your task by taking care of the boring, repetitive, and error·prone operations, freeing you to use your human faculties, insight, and curiosity in high·level activities  
· guided by your device’s *device·administrator*, assistants focus on the best way of performing a task or operation using past lessons, knowledge, and cooperation

#providing a smart, trusted device·administrator#
devices running Peoples•OS are managed by an **automated·device·administrator**  
· the administrator is a software agent tasked with looking after the user’s data and content, ensuring that it is private (encrypted), and protected against malfunctions, unauthorized access, or tampering (survives malfunctioning storage, hacking attacks by [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware), and user mistakes)  
· the administrator also manages task·assistants, and downloads or updates assistants as required  

the administrator relieves users from having to manage files and apps  
· users interact with the administrator interface to perform tasks  
· the administrator then calls on the appropriate assistants to perform the operations each task entails, on the appropriate data or content  

the administrator is robust, secure software that runs on a device using reliable subsystems such as [OpenZFS] to store and protect the user’s data
