![](_images/human-internet_logo.png)


the **human·internet** is the private and secure internet that humanity needs  
· this human information, connection, and collaboration network is built on the
[**InterPlanetary File System**][IPFS] (IPFS)  
· human·internet devices (comprising devices running [Peoples·OS][PeoplesOS]) connect to the network to share information, make connections with network denizens, and interact with digital·organisms to complete tasks and operations on behalf of device users  

the **Peoples** platform is a platform guided, owned, and operated by the·people (thru the **Peoples·Foundation**) to provide a humane, humanistic, and honorable alternative to Facebook, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, and other internet behemoths, whose main goal is *not* the advancement of individuals, groups, societies, and humanity    
· like the aforementioned entities, the Peoples platform aims to provide hardware, software, education, service, policy, and guidance to personal·information owners (human·beings) and personal·information users (human·beings, business entities) in the authoring, capturing, consumption, and management of personal·information, in addition to helping personal·information users to adhere to current and upcoming laws, regulations, and policy that specify how personal·information is to be used and disposed of
