>to ensure our continued existence, humanity must dedicate itself to populating the rest of the solar system in the next 100 years and [other star systems][Living_Universe] within the next 1000 years  
· this makes technological advancement our highest priority  
· this makes profit for profit’s sake irrelevant  
· this makes war a thing of the past  
· this makes care for our environment, efficient use of resources, and the advancement of humanity our only worthy goals  
· dedicating ourselves to these goals will give each of us [fulfilling occupations](https://youtu.be/tRHsq40f0pE "YouTube: The Drone Engineer Helping Farmers Work Smarter"), [food](https://youtu.be/of-fBY2Zj3Y "YouTube: Food Computers Are Here And They’re About To Revolutionize Agriculture"), and a bright, expanding future for our children  
· working together on those goals will help us not to hate each other for who we are  
· instead, we will cherish and respect one another for what we can contribute to humanity, to our future

Amazon, Apple, Facebook, and Google are good examples of entities that have improved lives and disrupted businesses and industries, but they have also behaved irresponsibly   
· they have gained power and influence, and reaped huge profits as a result of their innovations  
· however, with power comes responsibility, and most of these companies have not behaved humanely, and have [used their power irresponsibly or criminally][free_humanity]  
· in many cases and at [many levels][when_google_comes_to_town] these companies treat their customers as testers of their products and initiatives, putting customer data at risk and costing them significantly in wasted investment and unrealized value   
· some of these companies, like Facebook, have [behaved criminally](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/13/technology/facebook-data-deals-investigation.html "The New York Times: Facebook’s Data Deals Are Under Criminal Investigation")  
· and, even after many empty apologies, they continue to misbehave  
· that may be the reason behind young people’s [growing disdain](https://www.marketplace.org/2019/03/06/tech/exclusive-look-numbers-showing-users-leaving-facebook-by-the-millions) for the Facebook brand     

the internet·community includes cisgender and transgender people, scientists, politicians, strangers, friends, and criminals  
· the foundation that allows that community to exist is the [internet protocol suite][internet·protocol·suite], which, while facilitating reliable and resilient communication, does not ensure verifiable identity, reliable privacy, and strong security in the internet community  
· ***this is why people cannot trust the internet***  

many of the companies that operate on the internet, such as Facebook and Google, who publicly promise to be agents of good, have behaved dishonorably at best and criminally at worst  
· ***this is why people cannot trust the companies that operate on the internet***  

---  
people need a better foundation, a better internet, one that guarantees verifiable identity, reliable privacy, and strong security, so that companies that operate on it but still fail to protect people’s identity and data—due to negligence, incompetence, or criminality—can be admonished or punished appropriately  
· in addition to the hugely powerful and influential entities mentioned, new ones are being formed all the time  
· [travel and lodging specialists](https://qz.com/1567574/airbnb-is-buying-hoteltonight "Quartz: Airbnb is buying into the hotel industry by acquiring HotelTonight"), [entertainment powerhouses](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/03/20/business/media/walt-disney-21st-century-fox-deal.html "The New York Times: Disney Moves From Behemoth to Colossus With Closing of Fox Deal"), and [media conglomerates](https://www.businessinsider.com/att-time-warner-acquisition-what-it-will-own-2018-6 "Business Insider: Here's everything AT&T will own after it buys Time Warner")  
· in addition to the assets, expertise, and reach entities acquire to improve their business prospects, they acquire the personal·data of millions of individuals  
· with its purchase of HoteleTonight, Airbnb now has access to the locations and travel plans of the former’s human customers  
· control over more personal·information will help Airbnb grow its business and make it more attractive to investors  
· HotelTonight appears to have [respect](https://build.hoteltonight.com/handle-with-care-using-data-responsibly-9a0e6bcc5710) their human·customer’s data  
· Airbnb’s track record in that respect is [not great](https://www.theverge.com/2017/4/14/15308736/airbnb-multi-device-authentication-security-hackers "The Verge: Airbnb adds new security measures to prevent"), however, so the new entity’s effectiveness at keeping personal·information secure is an unknown quantity  
· therefore, after the merger, the security of the personal·data under HotelTonight’s control may be diminished in the newly formed entity  
· this situation does not instill confidence in the security chops of the new entity  

in addition to a strong foundation, the internet needs diversity of business models, experiences, and audiences  
· just a few corporations dominating every aspect of your digital·life is neither fair nor sustainable  
· it has been proven many times and in many areas that diversity creates environments where fresh ideas are explored and nurtured, where different points of view and cultures are part of acclaimed products and services  
· a monolithic company whose success is based only on network effects is incapable of satisfying the needs of 
all its users  
· what it does very well is attract users through its size and influence but not its features  
· such a company is not motivated to make its product better than the competition  
· its focus is on eliminating competition (using tactics such as acquisitions and mergers) or seeking user growth by applying its business·model on different markets  
· this is very logical, from a strictly business·growth perspective  
· but, from a humanistic perspective, a person staying in a service only because eir friends, family, and acquaintances are also with the service says very little about the quality of the service itself  
· people stay in it regardless of its mediocre experience and draconian interface because there is no real alternative, something that offers a better experience *and* access to the same family, friends, and acquaintances that the monolith provides  
· people need alternatives that are compatible with their sensibilities and tastes, and thru which they can interact effectively with their *only* family, friends, and acquaintances

&nbsp;  
personal·information is a valuable resource that must be respected and protected, not treated like an expendable commodity  
· companies collect vast amounts of personal·data from you, your web browsers, your devices, the businesses you visit, and entities dedicated to the trafficking of personal·information such as [eXelate][eXelate] and [BlueKai][BlueKai] (now part of Oracle)  
· instead of using that information to help you or humanity, those companies use it to target you with ads, to sell you stuff, to feed their artificial·intelligence models, to shape your thinking, to make you act against other individuals based on their gender, race, culture, ancestry, or way of thinking  

with their actions, these companies have earned their own disruption  
· you must wrestle from them the resource that makes them so powerful  
· that resource is your data, and you have the right and the power to take it from them  

the **People Own Data** (POD) movement represents the rights of individuals to control and manage data about themselves and any data that can be used to identify them  
· legally, individuals *own* such data (regardless of how it was captured or produced) and are free to allow access to their data to other entities and to dictate to those entities how that data is to be used and disposed of  
· these entities are *not* allowed to share personal·data with other entities, including parent companies, sibling entities, and business partners  
· entities who want or need to use any personal·information, must obtain authorization from the data·owner

this document introduces the solution to the internet’s identity, privacy, and security problems, and problems with the credibility of content on the internet    
· the solution is called the **human·internet**, and it will give you, your friends, your family, and humanity the power of your data, a superpower that has been stolen, sold, shared, and abused without your permission or consultation (for the most part) by entities dedicated not to your well being, your privacy, or your self·improvement, but to their own enrichment, at *any* cost

## EYES FORWARD
---
>to move humanity forward, you must reshape the business·model of the [personal·information oligarchs][personal·information_oligarchs], who mine, package, and process your life for profit, while putting your identity, privacy, and security at risk  

---
&nbsp;  

the future *is not* intelligent computing available only to big corporations  
· the future *is* people having the power of today’s desktop workstations on their wrists, today’s [high·performance·computing][high·performance·computing] available in their hands, and [exascale·computing][exascale·computing] power available on their laps and desks  

the future *is not* your information spread over data·silos everywhere, controlled by profit-blinded, unscrupulous, and criminal organizations  
· the future *is* a **datapod** (a managed collection of data and content controlled by the data·owner) with your data, accessed by trusted, responsible, and principled entities, who process your information on *your* behalf  

the future *is not* one monumentally flawed interpretation of [social·computing][social·computing]  
· the future *is* many interpretations of social·computing that are culturally sensitive, catered towards entertainers, politicians, intellectuals, teenagers, seniors, rocket·scientists, astronomers, biologists, swimmers, sky·divers, race·car·drivers, bicyclists, runners, dentists, surgeons, teachers, tailors, architects, runway·models, firefighters, police·officers, and lawyers, each with their own practices, norms, acceptable content, and so forth, which are *not* specified by companies with their eyes glued to the bottom lines of their balance sheets  

the future *is* the *dataweb,* featuring direct connections between data·items  
· **digital·entities** (also known as [**digital·organisms**][digital·organisms]) will be able to navigate data like you can navigate the web  
· these organisms will be smart because, in addition to having implicit knowledge and experience, they will be able to access any piece of connected data  
· and, because personal·data will no longer live in silos, all that data will be accessible at once  
· this will make digital·organisms capable of unimaginable things  

and this amazing power will be owned and controlled by *people*  
· this technology will be open to everyone  
· it *will not* be controlled by entities bent on making profits at any cost  
· in the future, when it comes to personal·information, people will have the first and last word because on Mars, on Europa, and on Proxima b there is no Facebook (Facebook is not an instrument of human·exploration, of human·advancement, it is an instrument of profit, for few)  
· people will take their data with them and their own internet when populating other planets and moons, and when traveling our galaxy   

the internet has gotten the way it is because it was developed without human values or principles  
· its creators could not have imagined the wonderful innovation it would facilitate  
· they also could not have imagined the abuse, disrespect, and contempt for digital·life that its major users would bring to humanity  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


## VISION, PRINCIPLES, VALUES
the internet lacks values  
· other than effectiveness and efficiency as a communication infrastructure, the internet has no human values  
· there are some [organizations](http://www.connected.org/is/values.html) who try to implant values on it  
· but, at its core, the [internet][internet_plan-internet] is a valueless, amoral network of computing devices exchanging information as efficiently as possible  
· without a vision and values geared towards humans, the internet’s infrastructure does not reflect any humane trait, nothing in its specifications and implementation say anything about guaranteeing the privacy, security, and safety of its human participants  
· because of that, it is easy for many entities on the internet to dedicate themselves to separate people from their money or to capture data about them and using it to obtain revenue, and not on improving the human condition  
· this is unsustainable self-destructive behavior  
· people eventually revolt against entities that operate against their best interests    
· just as with the [financial sector][industry_regulation] years ago, people will not take this anymore and will rebel against the companies that abuse them  

the internet of tomorrow, the human·internet, has a vision, principles, *and* values that guide its participants in their journey to help people be better people, and to move humanity forward  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### vision
the human·internet vision guides every aspect of its operation:  

  * **bring technological advancement** to individuals, societies, and humanity  
  * **educate** entities in the humane treatment of individuals and their personal·information  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### principles
the human·internet principles guide the development of human-centric technologies, policies, and rules used in the ecosystem:

  * entity·data must remain *private* unless the entity allows its disclosure  
  * entity·data must be *encrypted* at all times, except when needed during processing  
  * entity·data, even in its encrypted form, must be *protected* from unauthorized access  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### values
the human·internet values describe the behaviors expected of all participants in the ecosystem  
· violations to these values are grounds for suspension or expulsion from the ecosystem  
· you can remember these values using the acronym RISE:  

  * **respect**  
  · we respect the privacy and sovereignty of every participant  
  * **integrity**  
  · we are honest, open, and transparent in all our activities  
  * **service**  
  · we provide first-class service to people and to those who help them  
  * **excellence**  
  · we strive for and seek excellence in everything we do  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


## IDENTITY
the current internet infrastructure does not provide the protections required to guarantee the privacy and security of personal·data  
· a new infrastructure, based on real·identity and strong encryption, is needed

there are a number of [initiatives](http://identity.foundation "Decentralized Identity Foundation") and [projects](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/4/18249895/web-authentication-webauthn-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-standard-browsers "The Verge: The web just took a big step toward a password-free future") that aim at providing strong identity on the internet  
· but they are *worthless* if they do not have as their foundation a link to a person’s *real* identity (using credentials such as photo, name, birthdate, and birthplace), and are unable to guarantee that someone cannot assume a fake identity (or an identity that does not belong to sie) using contrived or stolen credentials  
· *privacy* is not the same as *anonymity*  
· in the human·internet, the former is desired, the latter is not  

you must be able to trust that every entity you deal with in the digital·world is real  
· the infrastructure on which entities operate must guarantee that they (individuals and organizations) are legal entities whose identities have been attested by trusted human·beings, such as notaries·public  
· no entity can be anonymous or use false identifying information to connect with other entities or publish content  
· you must be able to easily and immediately verify the source of any content you see to determine its authenticity  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


## POWER TO YOU
---
>the human·internet has human values  
· it serves you, and helps businesses serve you privately, respectfully, and honorably  
---
&nbsp;

the closer you are to your data, the more use you can get our of it  
· your data should be at your fingertips, without the need for a phone call or email  
· reviewing your latest medical test with your doctor’s notes while comfortably sitting on your couch is your right  
· being able to do that on your 4K television would be amazing  
· this is possible with your data at your fingertips  

your personal·information is more important than any corporation’s business model  
· you let companies access your data so that they can serve you   
· if you do not like how a company does business or do not like its service, you do not need to [*move*][data·transfer·project] your data to another company  
· you just need to give another company permission to access *your* data, the same data the other company lost its permission to access by failing you, or by not meeting your needs  

in the human·internet, your data is the center of the universe  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### eliminating data·silos
![](_images/data_silos.png)
&nbsp;

internet companies control your personal·information to make you to use their products, even though those products may be inferior to other similar services (remember, you are only a miniscule component of their growth strategy)  
· this is because, for the most part, people are not their ultimate customers  
· their real customers are the entities who pay them to [target people with ads](https://youtu.be/n2H8wx1aBiQ "YouTube: Senator, we run ads")  
· but when it comes to essential services, or ones that help people manage personal·information, such as social·services, healthcare·services (healthcare·providers), and health·insurance·services (health·plans), people need the flexibility that a multitude of products and services competing on merit—not on personal·information gathering practices—can provide  

these companies generally form **data·silos,** places that maintain collections of personal·data that provide them with business advantages  
· but for individuals and society, data·silos are both inefficient *and* ineffective  
· for example, healthcare providers would provide more effective service if they were able to access your entire body of health·information, not just the information they obtained directly from you or from other medical organizations that use compatible systems, or information they received through email, regular mail, or *faxes*  
· with comprehensive information in digital·form, doctors would make thoroughly informed and timely decisions, and the system as a whole would be more efficient, wasting fewer resources on the storage and maintenance of duplicate or redundant copies of health·information  

the data·silos healthcare·providers and health·plans rely on make for an ecosystem that forces you to ensure that the records each entity keeps on you are correct  
· this makes interacting with these entities tedious and mentally draining  
· why must you fill paper forms with your health·information when visiting a new medical facility?  
· and why must you fill the *same* forms with the *same* information, over and over?  

when entities use datapods to store and manage your health·data, efficiency increases, annoyance decreases, interactions between healthcare·providers and health·plans run smoother, and patients are happier *and* healthier thru fewer, more focused procedures  

---
credit reporting agencies duplicate data amongst themselves, and control data that is *yours*  
· these entities (members of the **Consumer Data Industry Association**) should store their research on your creditworthiness on your datapod  
· while such information would be modifiable only by them, you would be able to view and analyze it at no cost, anytime you like  
· with that information readily available (not only once a year), you would be able to make informed decisions related to your creditworthiness and would not have to seek reports from several agencies to ensure that all of them have the correct information  
· and when they fix their mistakes, you would be able to confirm it on the spot, in the place that serves as the authoritative store of that information  
· a single store of credit·data in your datapod would result in more efficient interactions regarding your credit·information  
· not to mention that these entities have proven incapable at protecting the valuable information they control, with Equifax putting millions of people in [peril][Equifax·breach], for example  
· in addition to not protecting your information, companies like Equifax do their best not to disclose the extent of the damage their negligence or incompetence causes people, which shows how little respect they have for their product (you *are not* their customer; you and your data are the *product* they offer their real customers)  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### owing your data
personal·data outlasts any [product](https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18246794/microsoft-band-refunds-apps-services-end-of-support-may-fitness-tracker "The Verge: Microsoft to offer Band refunds, announces end of apps and services"), any company, and any business·model  
· as the owner of your data, you should be able to have any capable entity manage and process it on your
 behalf  
· for example, you should be able to use the health·data captured on your Apple Watch (steps, heart·rate, and so forth) on your Chrome OS laptop  
· it is *your* health·data, not Apple’s health·data  

businesses come and go, your data is permanent and pervasive  
· a diabetic wants access to eir glucose levels from eir handheld, tablet, or desktop at all times  
· the comprehensive health·data you capture today, such as your step count and heart rate, may provide you and healthcare professionals critical information while researching a health issue 20 years from now  
· that health·data must be as useful (maybe, even more useful) in 20 years as it is today, regardless of the hardware and software used to capture it  

to ensure that data remains useful to its owner as long as that person is alive, we need to develop lasting data models, not tied to a particular company’s implementations  
· when companies introduce products that have to do with personal·information, they will need to submit those plans for consideration and further development to the Human·Internet Consortium (an organization composed of entities who participate in the human·internet)  
· there, those ideas will be considered as part of a “whole person” and “whole society” data infrastructure with the aim of ensuring that data recording using the resulting data and interaction·models are supported by the entire ecosystem, not just by the company who introduced it  
· in other words, wide data usability is assured at a fundamental level during feature design, not as an afterthought  
· we have seen how often companies introduce products to the marketplace that they view as testing platforms (funded by individuals sold on sales pitches), and later they leave individuals and even other companies in the lurch, with data that is largely useless, unless it is translated into a different format or structure  
· companies are free to innovate but, in the human·internet, they will innovate responsibly, with the needs and rights of individuals and humanity as their guiding light  
· *in the human·internet, no data is left behind*  

the beneficiaries of richer personal·data should include the subjects and owners of that data, not just the entities who collect the data  
· the companies who collect your data have shown that they are incapable of respecting 
and protecting it  
· they also have a tendency to abuse their access to your data  
· no matter their size, they are often breached, share your data with entities you do not know, or use it in ways they have not disclosed to you (or if they have, the did it on the legally binding contract you entered with them when you clicked Agree before starting to use their product or service; did you read it?)  

in a data-fair world, *all* your data (all data about you) is stored in your datapod  
· your health·data, your purchase·data, your entertainment·data, all data that identifies you or that can be used to identify you is stored in your datapod  
· this means that every entity you deal with stores data they collect about you in any way in your datapod  
· to do that, they have to have a relationship with you, and you have to have given them authorization to write data to your datapod  
· which means that entities who cannot access your datapod cannot collect data about you  
· this is the future of data ownership and control by people  

instead of you signing terms-of-use contracts where you grant use of your personal·data to a number of entities you do not know, the entities whom you authorize to access data in your datapod enter into contracts with you, promising to abide by your privacy settings, and not to share the data they get from the datapod with other entities  
· you entrust them with your data, and they *must* behave responsibly with it  
· that responsibility is not transferable  
· these entities are not allowed to share your data with any other entity, no business·partners, no subcontractors, no subsidiaries, and no parent companies (WhatsApp would be able to access your datapod, but not Facebook, for example)  
· therefore, if any third·party with which they share your personal·data is breached or otherwise loses control of your data, the entity you entrusted with your data is responsible and liable for the breach and data loss  

your data concentrated in a datapod provides several benefits:

* all your data is always up to date and coherent, this is your personal·data’s *single point of truth*    
* the effort for all authorized parties to get up-to-date information and to keep it that way is minimized  
* you always have the current view of your data (you do not need to ask anyone for access or permission to access your own information)  
* you can view present and past versions of your data  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### authorizing data·specialists to access your data
a **data·specialist** is an entity capable of reading or writing data in a datapod  
· there can be health·data specialists, such as healthcare·providers, and health·plans; social·data specialists, such as social·services; financial·data specialists, such as banks and investment·firms  
· these specialists are further divided into *consumers* and *administrators*  
· **data·consumers** can only read data  
· **data·administrators** can add, read, modify, and delete data  

a social·service that helps you make connections is an example of a social·data·administrator  
· while a calendar·service is an example of an event·data·administrator and a social·data·consumer  

a datapod keeps your data safe and protected against access and tampering from entities you do not know, but you need to authorize access to it to data·specialists you trust so that they can read or manage the type of personal·data in which they specialize and to which you grant them access   
· you do this using special software in a personal·device such as a handheld or a tablet  

only the entities each datapod’s owner authorizes can access the contained data  
· not even the datapod service provider can access the data  
· data is always encrypted using the strongest encryption available  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### sharing your data with trusted people
a strong identity·infrastructure provides people and organizations with significant capabilities  
· the flexible authentication and authorization features made possible by the human·internet allow you to grant trusted individuals (and even some organizations) direct access to your data, in case you are incapacitated or need others to have such access, such as your spouse  

when you grant another person direct access to your data, that person can access it with the same flexibility you have, through the data·specialists you have authorized to access your datapod   

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### publishing and viewing whatever you want
no one should dictate what content you can publish and what content you can view on your devices  
· you are your own platform, and you have freedom of speech  
· you can publish any legal content you want  
· no one can tell you what to publish and what not to publish  

on the other hand, you can specify the type of content you want to view and your desired sources of that content  
· if you do not find a source credible (even after verifying its identity), you can add it to your undesirable·sources list, or remove it from your desirable·sources list  

you have total control over the content you publish and the content you view because, the future  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### sharing different aspects of your life
you may have a personal life, a professional life, and a political life, which you could separate by using three social·services, such as Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter  
· some services let you crosspost to others, for example, a Facebook post can be duplicated in a Twitter tweet  
· in the human·internet *you* are your own platform; therefore, you do not need other platforms to define you or any aspect of your digital·life  
· you can use different *aspects* of your digital·life to compartmentalize parts of your life, to make it easier on you and your followers to produce and consume content  
· people will be able to follow the “whole you” or only the “professional you”  
· although you have a single identity, it can be separated into aspects that can be used across services  
· therefore, instead of “follow me at @you,” you could tell people interested in your political musings “follow me at you~politics”

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### founding groups and communities
you can found groups and communities that are platforms of their own  
· if you want to be part of a platform that is bigger than yourself, you can start groups or communities that exhibit traits you share with others  
· groups and communities can establish rules for acceptable content   
· they may also develop capabilities that present specialized content or facilitate custom interactions 
between members  

these entities could be the foundation of mini social·services that may satisfy the belonging needs of most people, eliminating the need to join generalized social·services that are incapable of catering to particular audiences, and whose goals are not to help individuals, societies, or humanity, but to enrich themselves by collecting revenue from their real customers, advertisers  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### universal privacy settings
you can set the parameters for access and disposition of your personal·data, which the entities you authorize to access data in your datapod must adhere to  
· you do this thru an easy-to-use interface on your personal·device, no emails or phone calls needed   

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### your personal·information dashboard
with your personal·data managed in a datapod, you can view and analyze all your activity at any point  
· you can know what entities modified your data and why  
· you can monitor your financial activity and see what medical services your health·plan has paid for, and know when your last lab tests are ready for your doctor to analyze  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


## POWER TO THE PEOPLE
---
>as people learn how their personal·information is used by data·brokers and data·traffickers, they will increasingly reject the [surveillance·economy][surveillance·economy]  

---
&nbsp;

when society loses respect for a dominating entity, the entity loses influence, and society looks for alternatives  
· due to our increasing reliance on the internet and our digital·devices, people want to be able to trust the entities they deal with on the internet, but neither the entities nor the internet itself provide the reliable, trusted infrastructure to facilitate that    

instead of companies using your data to [enrich themselves](https://youtu.be/8KYugpMDXAE), you should be able pool your data with that of other individuals to take humanity forward, generating *human profit*  
· the real power of data lies in having access to vast amounts of it  
· advertisers, together with platforms like Facebook’s and Google’s, use this to target people with ads  
· but it can also be used to research cures for diseases, to learn about the real makeup of communities and societies to develop social·programs, to determine the movements of people after a natural disaster to design cities that cope better with such events  
· pooling people’s data together to answer questions to benefit humanity is a great humane use of technology  
· but it must be done in a way that ensures people’s privacy and the security of their data, and that denies entities whose motives are not compatible with those goals access to that data    

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### leveraging people·data
regardless of the datapod service provider you use, your data and content will be seamlessly available to members of the ecosystem  
· people searching and navigating content in the ecosystem need not be aware that content is federated among service providers  
· thus, the ecosystem provides the best of a single point of entry for finding and navigating content, and region-specific or otherwise specialized data storage and service for individuals (and other entities with private data of their own)  
· however, in addition to you controlling your data, *people* control their data  

collections of datapods can become valuable repositories of personal·data, data that individuals nurture and keep updated because they feel that they have effective control over it  
· they also know that by enriching it with additional information and context, they make the data more valuable to entities who need to work with that data, either on the data owner’s behalf or their own behalf  
· such a rich collection of data can prove so valuable, at an individual level as well as on aggregate, that it entices data·specialists to pay for its access, contributing to the development and improvement of the open ecosystem that allows them to operate seamlessly, cooperatively, and profitably *on behalf of individuals*  
· thus, the human·internet is a market for managed access to personal·information that would more closely reflect the interests of the individuals whose data is used to fuel the operations of small and large businesses  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### facilitating real competition
---
>only a large group of cooperating nonprofit, public·benefit,  and for·profit entities, united under the principles and values of the human·internet, can be a capable and effective alternative to the internet oligarchy that is pilfering, and profiting from our personal·information, and using their vast, ill-gained resources, to bend rules and laws in their favor  

---

people need an alternative to closed, monolithic, untrustworthy, abusive, and criminal companies  
· several honorable, trustworthy companies of all sizes whose only differentiators are the features and quality of their products, not the data they hold hostage, will make for a richer, more diverse, and safer ecosystem, which can more closely match the needs and wants of people  
· multiple experiences, generated using the same data, by companies with different backgrounds, sensitivities, and target audiences would make for an ecosystem that provides the perfect products for specific groups of people, while promoting inclusion, tolerance, and community for all people  

you need an open environment that promotes the creation and nurture of many competing and complementary services that cater to your specific needs, which are unlike the needs of other individuals  
· in such an environment, you would be able to choose the services that best address your needs, instead of having to use the only one that has garnered enough users to make it attractive to investors, despite all its many and profound disadvantages  

for example, instead of one big social·service provider whose approach to social·networking, privacy, interface, and overall experience you do not like, you should be able to use two (or more) providers, one that caters to the politician in you, providing tools that let you analyze the political make up of districts, and one that specializes in your inner scientist, providing bespoke content about the latest advances in biological and nuclear research  
· because both services use the social·data from your datapod (your *one* social·graph), your connections, relations, groups, and communities are the same in both services  
· but each of them offers custom interaction models that match the expectations of each service’s target audience  
· with capable smart·software as a foundation, your social·interface would be an amalgam of the features of the two services, providing a smooth social·experience in which you get the best of both services   
· this way, your digital social·life would be richer, more efficient, and more satisfying than what one big, unfocused social·service can provide  

[**Shapr**][Shapr] is a social·network that facilitates introductions between professionals using a [**Tinder**][Tinder]-like interface    
· although [**LinkedIn**][LinkedIn] is a social·network for professionals too, it does not offer Shapr’s narrowly focused functionality (Shapr’s sole purpose is to help people make connections)  
· LinkedIn suggests connections between people, but the basis on which the service makes those suggestions is vastly different from Shapr’s (LinkedIn’s recommendations are based largely on the people you are already connected to thru LinkedIn)  
· plus, the entire Shapr experience, from first launch to daily use, exudes its narrow goal of helping you connect with others  
· [**Facebook**][Facebook] also makes connection suggestions, but the reasons that drive it to make them are also not as explicit as Shapr’s  
· Shapr not only lets you specify your interests and whether you want to meet people based on your location, its Tinder-like interface reduces the rejection anxiety that the LinkedIn and Facebook experiences can create  
· Shapr’s goal of helping people meet someone new every day sets it apart from companies like LinkedIn and Facebook, which have more general goals  

a service that offers an experience similar to Shapr’s but dedicated to improving women’s experience by encouraging them to make the first move (in heterosexual dating), is [Bumble][Bumble]  
· the Bumble philosophy is to empower women in relationship building, to make the process more equitable  
· Bumble also lets you link your Instagram and Spotify accounts  
· in a datapod-based ecosystem, these types of explicit linkages between services at the app level would not be needed  
· everything would be related because the underlying link, your data, is what would define those relationships  
· so your posts and your music tastes would be accessible to services like Bumble (if you authorize it), regardless of which service you use to make the posts (Instagram or Tumblr) or to listen to music (Spotify or Apple Music)    

in the ecosystem of tomorrow, services like Tinder, Shapr, and Bumble would use a lot of the same information from peoples’ datapods  
· they would also use the same basic interactions to work on data, which reduces mistakes and ensures that data is not corrupted by using thoroughly tested methods (in the human·internet, personal·data is a high-value resource that is cared for seriously; it does not [break](https://xkcd.com/1428 "xkcd: Move Fast and Break Things") anybody’s data, as some companies do so willingly)  
· their success would rest on their providers’ capability to attract and motivate people to try them out and to keep using them based on the efficiency of their interfaces, the appeal of their experiences, and on the trust the community puts on their effectiveness, their professionalism, and their competence at keeping the data they access private and secure  

in this ecosystem, you are in control  
· if you want to get connection suggestions, you can get them, the way you want  
· if you do not want to receive connection suggestions, you will not  
· there is no profit·maximizing motive to grow your connections (to grow the size of a platform’s product, like Facebook and LinkedIn require to be more attractive to advertisers)  
---
vast personal·data collections will no longer be a competitive·advantage for data·brokers because people will take their data with them to places they trust  
· an entity’s competitive·advantage will be composed of its principles, its values, and its reputation  
· more than “exits,” company founders will focus on the meaning of their ventures to themselves, their target audience and the world  
· this will be a strong catalyst for the creation of long-lasting companies and business·models, which provides lasting value to investors  
· after unprecedented growth, companies like Facebook and Apple are having trouble connecting with new audiences because they are straying from the values that made them great in the past  
· values like integrity, simplicity, elegance, usability, connection, service, reliability, soul, experience, and individuality have been placed behind growth, profit, and influence  

---
the Apple software ecosystem provides a solid foundation upon which innovative companies build compelling products that run on Apple’s platforms like macOS, iOS, and watchOS  
· people need a similar ecosystem that allows innovative companies to build compelling products that run on many platforms, including BSD, GNU/Linux, Android, Windows, and [vw.OS][vw.OS]  
· multiple companies following one core vision for the internet, one that puts individuals, societies, and humanity at its center, will be a strong, diverse, and resilient alternative to the behemoths that dominate the internet today  

such federated but highly integrated ecosystem would provide the baseline from which companies are free to innovate using their expertise to create interfaces and experiences that satisfy their audiences  
· by ensuring the quality, reliability, and security of their services, and performing their operations honorably and respectfully, each company maximizes its chances of captivating customers who would be dedicated to their success because those customers would have their *trust*  
· those customers would give these companies the best publicity available: word of mouth  
· personal·data would be a common, shared resource that underlies the interactions between people and multiple companies, each focused on what it does best on behalf of their customers  
· this woud be a highly efficient ecosystem with people at its center but with businesses benefiting from an infrastructure that helps them keep the valuable resource they work with private and secure  

having one or two *premium* platforms is nice  
· but making our entire digital ecosystem premium would be a lot more beneficial to humanity  
· connecting *all* of a person’s devices—watches, handhelds, cars, and home·automation devices—to eir data, not only those from one manufacturer, would be more humane  
· the human·internet is the ecosystem of the future, the one that nurtures all devices, all platforms, all operating·systems, all working together helping people to connect better, relate better, communicate better, and *be* better, together  

if you want to start a business, you will not have to worry about *hacking* the growth of the business ([growth·hacking][growth·hacking] is dishonest)  
· all you have to do is start your business, whether it is a social·service, a health·service, a repair·service, an education·service, a data·processing·service, or whatever, is to determine why you want to start your business and make sura that the reason is compatible with the human·internet principles and values  
· with people more aware of the power of their data, your chances at success are greater than ever, as long as you are responsible, honorable, and accountable for your actions  
· the human·internet is the new, egalitarian ecosystem full of opportunity to all kinds of innovative business·ideas  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;  


## DIGITAL ECOSYSTEM
---
>humanity’s greatest advances have been done in the open, through participation and cooperation whose goal is the common good  

---
&nbsp;  
in the U.S. the rail system built in the 1800s provided profit and wealth to the entrepreneurs who broke ground through new territory  
· in the 1900s the interstate highway system, although largely motivated by the logistical needs of the U.S. military, was a great boon for the transportation, automobile, and tourism industries  
· it gave new options and greater capabilities for individuals and families to move about the country, for business or pleasure  
· it facilitated the creation of a diverse transportation market, dedicated to particular regions, and specialized in the transportation of specific products  
· this provided economic success to not just railway industrialists, but to countless road-based freight companies who benefited from having a common highway system with laws, rules, and policies that govern its use  
· now, people and businesses have a myriad ground·transportation options when they need to ship, either products or themselves, across the country  
· no one can argue that the interstate highway system is not an improvement over the railway system, an improvement that through planning, rules, and policies has brought great prosperity to American society, not just made a few corporations richer  

an internet with human principles and values, the human·internet, can do for our digital·lives what the interstate highway system did for transportation: made it more equitable and accessible to businesses, while providing more flexibility to individuals, groups, communities, and humanity  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### compelling experiences
software must be smart, it must help people, not give people things to do  
· it must make people’s digital·lives simpler, not more complicated with “error” messages, or intricate, hard-to-understand interfaces 

a compelling experience is one full of options for performing tasks, with the certainty that those tasks will be completed timely and correctly  
· similar to how you have options for going from your home to the airport  
· you could drive yourself, use a ride·sharing service, or take a taxi  
· each of those options offers amenities and limitations  
· but in the end you end, all of them take you from your home to the airport  

people need hardware that lasts  
· our love affair with gadgets will diminish  
· battery, capacitor, and other energy·storage technologies will become a lot better in the coming years, to the point where charging devices is something people do not think about, either because it is done automatically, or the need for it is nonexistent  

an efficient, distributed, and federated infrastructure is flexible and resilient  
· core service providers basing their operations on the [InterPlanetary File System][IPFS] will provide the resiliency, redundancy, and security needed to guarantee human·internet users that their data remains private and secure, accessible only to those they authorize   
· but federation is an implementation detail  
· users do not have to know which service providers a person uses to host eir data and content  
· the human·internet is one large community of people and other entities that can request an introduction and make connections to one another, safely and respecting everyone’s privacy  
· this is what it needs to be an effective alternative to Facebook  
· its single vision gives people confidence in its operation, while its federated structure lets many entities provide products that are tailored to specific communities whose members can interact and relate to each other seamlessly  
· Facebook cannot provide that level of specialization because its purpose is to *unite the world under Facebook*, so that it can serve ads to that world  
· it is not really interested in meeting the needs of its product (the users)  
· instead, if focuses on making its product attractive to its customers: entities who want to reach people using a wide array of parameters Facebook makes available from its treasure trove of personal·information  
· in this model, Facebook facilitates transactions between strangers, but Shapr would facilitate meaningful *relationships* between entities with things in common  

the human·internet will provide the same advertisers a more humane way to reach people  
· instead of pushing products and services either blindingly by using dishonorable tactics, advertisers will be able to rely on *personal introductions*  
· they will make meaningful and lasting connections to each person thru a trusted entity that both find capable of representing their interests and handling personal·information privately and securely  
· these intermediaries are data·specialists who vouch for the trustworthiness and competence of the advertisers to their human customers  
· for example, if you trust Shapr to handle your social·data and provide you with social·services, and allow it to recommend connections to nonhuman entities, it may recommend entities that are compatible with your tastes without disclosing any of your personal·information  
· this will obsolete business models that rely on the capture and control of personal·information, and make *personal·connection* the new business advantage  

what will move us are forward is trust, security, and safety, something we lack today  
· the software that will make that happen will run on powerful, reliable, open hardware that is operational for 20 years or longer  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### human-focused infrastructure
people need an environment that respects their privacy, ensures the security of their data, and strives for their safety  
· people will not accept privacy-violating practices that normal now  
· requiring your phone number to use a service will not be tolerated  
· services like [GroupMe][GroupMe] that require the phone numbers of all participants are not humane because, instead of facilitating real connections between people, they require the disclosure of personal·information for basic functionality  
· real personal·connections are between people, not their devices or specific communication infrastructure  

data·collection, data·processing, and data·disposition rules are different in different countries or regions  
· the data·processing and data·disposition rules followed by your datapod host must comply with the law and rules for the region on which it operates  
· you may have multiple datapods for multiple regions, for example, if you hold dual citizenship in the U.S. and an European country and spend considerable time in both  
· you can designate your European datapod for use by European businesses, and your U.S. datapod for 
U.S. organizations  

different societies and cultures may have particular ways for structuring and dealing with data  
· your datapod host must fully support your language, culture, and other characteristics that define you and your society  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### common data language
just like a society benefits from speaking the same language, entities using a common data language when working with personal·information makes it simpler and more efficient to process information  
· the Human·Internet Consortium would ensure that data·models are not duplicated so that, for example, entities that deal with data from fitness gear use one language to interact with many types of fitness devices from many manufacturers  
· a data language maintained by an entity separate from the entities who use it ensures that data remains viable even after the pioneering entity who introduced it disappears or switches priorities  
· the long-lasting viability of data is essential for people to trust that companies cannot harm their existing data, and that new data is not abandoned  
· this will make it easier for people to try services in search of the perfect one, while keeping their data safe and usable all along  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### exhaustive testing and quality control
before new data·models and methods for processing them are introduced to the human·internet, they will be tested for a number of years  
· in the human·internet, we move slow and break nothing because we care about people and their data  
· the usability, safety, and security of data is goal number one  
· this applies to all products and services offered on the human·internet  
· entities will not be allowed to put peoples’ data at risk, regardless of their size  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### security and reliability by design
the infrastructure you and the entities you authorize to access your personal·data must guarantee the privacy and security of your data when it is stored and when it is transmitted  
· banks do not rely only on safes to secure cash and security instruments  
· they put those vaults in secure areas within secure buildings with strong doors, alarms, guards, security services, *and* arrangements with police departments  
· they key is *redundancy*  
· we must take a similar approach to ensure that personal·information is always secure  
· *efficiency* must take second place to security  

while in their custody, entities are fully responsible and accountable for the security of your data  
· if your data is not encrypted and the entity’s systems are breached, the entity is accountable for its loss and misuse  

reliability is also paramount  
· the software that makes up the backbone of the human·internet (the foundation·software) will be released every five years, after two years of development, two years of engineering testing, two years of user testing, and one year of integration and upgrade testing (engineering and user testing run concurrently)  
· the foundation·software will comprise software technologies and components that have been in use without problems for at least five years  
· except for security issues, such software will not be updated until the next release of the 
human·internet’s software  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  

### facilitating real cooperation
---
> Amazon runs two kinds of businesses: 
> • one is a platform, the place where small businesses trade, and buyers and sellers meet  
> · Amazon runs the platform but also sucks out tons of information from every single transaction  
> • it then uses that information, which no one else is privy to, to identify profitable businesses, which it then competes against  
> · it then puts out a product in competition with the Pet Pillow sales guy, and moves that profitable business back to page 6, and puts Amazon’s own business at the front   
> 
> using a baseball analogy, you could be the umpire (the platform), or you could have a team in the game (running individual businesses that meet on the platform)  
>  but you don’t get to do both simultaneously  
> [Elizabeth Warren](https://youtu.be/9b1iDMW0y7s "YouTube: Elizabeth Warren on Breaking Up “Big Tech”")

---
businesses are like kids playing in the same playpen  
· to be happy and have real fun, kids learn to share, take turns, and show others how rewarding a particular 
activity can be  
· businesses today are selfish, domineering, and bully their way through life  
· this has produced entities that put the environment and human·lives at risk because the goal is not to help people be better or even to guarantee their safety but to defeat almost everyone else, at any cost  
· this is how companies that started with altruistic goals, such as Google and Facebook, have degenerated into the inhumane entities they are today  
· staying focused on the needs and rights of individuals is how companies can remain helpful to society and humanity despite changes in business realities and demands from shareholders  

Amazon is both a marketplace and the largest participant of that marketplace, which it has used to leverage the data it collects through marketplace interactions to copy *and* eliminate its competition  
· instead of being selfish bullies, business can cooperate on open platforms that facilitate business-to-business interactions, knowing that no one business will have an unfair advantage over the other participants  
· businesses can contribute their knowledge and expertise in developing highly capable and flexible platforms that raise everybody’s changes at success, and they get to compete on merit with their business siblings  

a strong identity framework (describer earlier) will be instrumental in allowing business-to-business trust and honest and transparent cooperation, something that will benefit not only business entities, but the human·beings who participate in that environment    

---
the human·internet implements the common language that participants use to work privately and security with personal·information in a way that keeps human·beings at the center of its operations  
· the human·internet is how people will learn, work, relate, communicate, and live digitally  
· it is also the infrastructure that allows organizations and company to serve people and other entities honorably and responsibly  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


## GETTING STARTED
exciting, right?  
· so, what do we need to get this futuristic, humanistic, and humane digital ecosystem going?  

there are three things we can do to hasten the human·internet’s design, implementation, and safe deployment:  

  * start the conversation
  * design and implementing models, platforms, and infrastructure
  * develop products and services

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### starting the conversation
to get a lively and informative conversation going, we can found the Human Internet Consortium  
· entities of all types (individuals and nonprofit, public·benefit, and for·profit entities) can join to agree on the vision, policies, and rules of the human·internet  
· all knowledge and expertise is valuable in designing an open, privacy-focused, secure, and safe ecosystem where individuals are the main beneficiaries  
· entities who work with personal·data can make their views known so that the ecosystem can accommodate their needs as closely as possible, while prioritizing the privacy, security, and safety rights of individuals  
· in light of upcoming regulation (even calls for the break-up of some large entities), helping to craft the next generation of the internet, one that is more attuned to the needs of human·beings and that limits the direct influence of such entities, may help preclude drastic regulation and antitrust proceedings, while creating an environment with equal chances of success for all participants  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### designing and implementing models, platforms, and infrastructure
to guarantee that the data·specialists who participate in the human·internet enjoy an environment where all of them have the same access to people and opportunities for profit, the entities who design and implement the open models, platforms, and infrastructure of the human·internet must not have a profit motive  
· this is how the human·internet will ensure a fair playing field for all participants  
· as Elizabeth Warren puts it, you are either an umpire or a player, never both  
· while, all members of the Human Internet Consortium can make suggestions and submit proposals, only nonprofit entities can perform the official design and implementation work that defines the infrastructure 
of the human·internet  
· nonprofit entities interested in helping craft the next great digital ecosystem for humanity can become *working members*  
· one such nonprofit entity is **Peoples·Foundation**  

this work can be funded by humanistic and humane organizations, government programs, and any entity who wants to ensure that the human·internet gets the best start possible  

&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  


### developing products and services
with a fair, privacy-focused playing field in place, the human·internet will need businesses to create compelling products and services for people to use  
· entities interested in making profits while operating honorably and responsibly with personal·information in the human·internet can participate in its development by developing products and services that run on it  
· these novel and innovative products will (almost by default) have a higher level of respect for human·dignity, data·privacy, data·security, and personal safety than the internet of today offers
· entities willing to operate in an environment where people have strong actual control over how their personal·data is used will enjoy better publicity for themselves and stronger, more meaningful relationships with their human customers, whom are the *actual* backbone of the internet  

while the preliminary infrastructure of the human·internet is implemented, entities with an eye on producing profits honorably can develop services and products concurrently, ensuring that they are ready at the human·internet’s birthdate on 2025  
· investors of all types can fund entities that will reap the benefits of operating in an ecosystem that people can trust and that will not allow the nefarious behaviors that are possible today
