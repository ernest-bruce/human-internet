# Disrupting the Disruptors, Because Humanity—A Manifesto√
![](_images/data_silos.png)
&nbsp;

Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon are good examples of entities that have disrupted people’s lives, businesses, and industries but whom have behaved irresponsibly afterward    
· they have gained power and influence, and reaped huge profits as a result of their disruptions  
· however, with power comes responsibility, and most of these companies have not used their power responsibly  
· some of them, like Facebook, have even behaved criminally  
· and, after many apologies, they continue to behave irresponsibly and criminally, again, Facebook is the prime example of this behavior  

the internet·community includes cisgender and transgender people, scientists, politicians, strangers, friends, criminals, and subcommunities like users of Facebook, Apple, or Google products  
· the foundation of that community is the [internet protocol suite][internet·protocol·suite], which, while facilitating reliable and resilient communicatio, does not ensure verifiable identity, reliable privacy, and strong security on the internet  
· this is why people cannot trust the internet  

many of the companies that operate on the internet, such as Facebook and Google, who publicly promise to be agents of good for humanity, have behaved dishonorably at best and criminally at worst  
· this is why people cannot trust the companies that operate on the internet  

people need a better foundation, a better internet, one that guarantees verifiable identity, reliable privacy, and strong security, so that companies that operate on it but still fail to protect people’s identity and data—due to negligence, incompetence, or criminality—can be fully blamed for those failures, and admonished or punished appropriately  

the internet needs diversity of business models, experiences, and audiences  
· just a few corporations dominating every aspect of person’s digital life is neither fair nor sustainable  
· it has been proven many times and in many areas that diversity creates environments where fresh ideas are explored and nurtured, where different points of view and cultures are part of acclaimed products and services  
· a monolithic company basing its success on network effects is incapable of satisfying the needs of all its users  
· what it does very well is attract users through its size and influence, but not is features and what makes it better than the competition (eliminating competition through network effects reduces the need to be better than the competition)  
· but, from a humanistic perspective, a person staying in a service only because eir friends, family, and acquaintances are also with the service says very little about the quality of the service itself  
· people stay in it regardless of its mediocre experience and draconian interface because there is no real alternative, something that offers a better experience *and* access to the same family, friends, and acquaintances that the monolith provides  
· people need alternatives that are compatible with their sensibilities and tasttes, and thru which they can interact effectively with their *only* family, friends, and acquaintances  
&nbsp;

> the time when innovative, transcendent products and servicies die due to their *failure* to reach user-based economies of scale is over

&nbsp;

when society loses respect for a dominating entity, the entity loses influence, and society looks for alternatives  
· in 2019, people want to be able to trust the entities they deal with on the internet, but neither the entities nor the internet itself provide the infrastructure to facilitate that    

personal·information is a valuable resource that must be respected and protected, not treated like an expendable commodity  
· companies collect vast amounts of personal·data from you, your web browsers, your devices, the businesses you visit, and entities dedicated to the trafficking of personal·inforation such as [eXelate][eXelate] and [BlueKai][BlueKai] (now part of Oracle)
· but, instead of using that information to help you or humanity, those companies use it to target you with ads, to sell you stuff, to shape your thinking, to make you act against other individuals based on their gender, race, culture, ancestry, or way of thinking  

with their actions, these companies have earned their own disruption  
· you must wrestle from them the resource that makes them so powerful  
· that resource is your data, and you have the power to take it from them

## reclaiming your power√
companies maintain personal·information on their own systems force you to use their service even though it may be inferior to other services  
· people need the flexibility that a multitude of products and services competing on merit can provide  

data·silos are both inefficient *and* ineffective
· healthcare providers should be able to see your entire body of health·information, not just their specializations  
· with comprehensive information doctors can make informed decisions—without ordering potentially duplicate tests—and the system as a whole is more efficient  

multiple entities maintaining copies of your health·data is wasteful and inefficient  
· credit reporting agencies duplicate data amongst themselves, and control data that is *yours*  
· these entities should store your credit·information in your datapod  
· this information would be modifiable only by members of the **Consumer Data Industry Association** (CDIA)  
· but you would be able to view and analyze that information at no cost, anytime you like  
· with that information readily available (not only once a year), you would be able to make informed decisions related to your creditworthiness, and would not have to seek reports from several agencies to ensure that all of them have the correct information  
· a single store of credit·data in your datapod would result in more efficient interactions regarding your credit·information  
· not to mention that these entities have proven incapable at protecting the valable information they control, with [Equifax] putting millions of people in [peril][Equifax·breach]  
· in addition to not protecting your information, companies like Equifax do their best not to disclose the extent of the damage their incompetence causes to people, which shows how little they respect their products (you *are not* their customer; you and your data are the products they offer their real customers)

healthcare·providers and health·plans also rely on data·silos  
· this creates annoying synchronization problems that make interacting with entities that work with your health·information tedious and mentally draining  
· why must you fill paper forms with your health·information when visiting a new medical facility, in 2019?  
· and why must you fill the *same* forms with the *same* information, over and over?  
· when entities use your datapod to store and manage *your* health·data, efficiency increases, annoyance decreases, interactions between healthcare·providers and health·plans run smoother, and patients are happier *and* healthier thru fewer more focused procedures  

&nbsp;

### owing your data√
personal·data outlasts any business·model and any company  
· as the owner of your personal·data, you must be able to have any capable entity manage and process your data on your behalf  
· for example, you must be able to use the health·data captured on your Apple Watch (steps, heart·rate, and so forth) on your Chrome OS laptop  
· it is *your* health data, not Apple’s health·data

&nbsp;
> the closer you are to your data, the more use you can get our of it  
&nbsp;

the **Peoples Own Data** movement represents the rights of individuals to control and manage data about themselves and any data that can be used to identify them  
· individuals *own* such data and are free to allow access to their data to other entities and to dictate to those entities how that data is to be used and disposed of  
· entities are *not* allowed share personal·data with other entities, including parent companies, sibling entities, and business partners  
· entities who want or need to use any personal·information, must access it thru personal **datapods** (managed collections of data and content controlled by the data·owner)

the beneficiaries of richer personal·information should be the subjects and owners of that data, not just the entities that collect the data  
· unfortunately, the companies that collect your data have shown that they are incapable of respecting and protecting it
· they also have a tendency of abusing their access to that data  
· no matter their size, they are often breached, share your data with entities you do not know, or they use it in ways they have not disclosed to you (or if they have, the did it on the legally binding contract you entered with them when you clicked Agree before starting to use their product or service)  

in a data-fair world, *all* your data (all data about you) must be stored on your datapod  
· your health·data, your purchase·data, your entertainment·data, all data that identifies you or that can be used to identify you must be stored in your datapod  
· this means that every entity you deal with must store data they collect about you in any way on your datapod  

instead of you signing terms-of-use contracts where you grant use of your personal·data to a number of entities you do not know, the entities that you authorize to access data in your datapod enter into contracts with you, promising to abide by your privacy settings, and not to share the data they get from the datapod with other entities  
· you entrust them with your data, and they *must* behave responsibly with it  
· that responsibility is not transferrable  
· entities are not allowed to share your data with any other entity, no business·partners, no subcontractors, no subsidiaries  
· therefore, if any third·party with which they share your personal·data is breached or otherwise loses control of your data, the entity you entrusted wit your data is responsible and liable for the breach and data loss  

&nbsp;

### sharing your data with trusted people

&nbsp;

### publishing and viewing whatever you want√
you are your own platform, and you have freedom of speech  
· you can publish any legal content yu want  
· no one can tell you what to publish and what not to publish  

on the other hand, you can specify the type of content you want to view and your desired sources of that content  
· if you do not find a source credible (even afte verifying its identity), you can add it to your undesirable·source list, or remove it from desirable·source list  

&nbsp;
> no one should tell you or dictate what content you can publish and what content you can view on your devices  
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

### establishing your digital identity

&nbsp;

### founding real groups and communities

&nbsp;

### universal privacy settings√
you must be able to set the parameters for access and disposition of your personal·data, which entities authorized to access data in your datapod must adhere to  
· you should be able to do this thru an easy-to-use interface on a personal device such as a handheld, tablet, or desktop  

&nbsp;

### your personal·information dashboard


&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## claiming the peoples power

instead of companies using your data to [enrich themselves](https://youtu.be/8KYugpMDXAE), you should be able pool your data with other individuals to take humanity forward, the *human profit*  

&nbsp;

### authorizing data specialists to access your data

&nbsp;

### facilitating real competition√
people need an environment that catalyzes the creation and nurture of many competing services that cater to particular audiences  
· this way people can choose the services that best address their needs, instead of having to use the only one that has garnered enough users to make it attractive to investors, despite all its disadvantages    
· for example, instead of one big social·service provider whose approach to social·networking, interface, and overall experience you do not like, you should be able to use two providers, one that caters to politics, providing tools that let you analyze the political make up of districts, and one that specializes in science, providing bespoke content about the workings of the human brain  
· because both services use the social·data from your datapod, your connections, relations, groups, and communities are the same in both services  
· but each of them offers custom interaction models, which match the expectations of each service’s target audience  
· this way, your digital social·life is richer, more efficient, and more satisfying than what one big, unfocused social·service can provide  



&nbsp;

### leveraging the·peoples data√
in addition to you controlling your data, *people* should control their data  
· collections of datapods managed by service providers can become valuable repositories of personal·data, data that individuals nurture and keep updated because they feel that they have effective control over it  
· they also know that by enriching it with additional context, they make the data more valuable to entities that need to work with that data, either on the data owner’s behalf or their own behalf  
· such a rich collection of data, which people update themselves to make it more useful, can prove so valuable, at an individual level as well as in aggreagate, to entice data-processing entities to pay the service providers for its access    

regardless of the datapod service provider a person uses, that person’s data and content are seamlessly available to all members of the ecosystem  
· people searching and navigating content in the ecosystem need not be aware that content is federated among service providers  
· thus, the ecosystem provides the best of a single point of entry for finding and navigating content, and region-specific or otherwise specialized data storage and service for individuals  

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## digital ecosystem

&nbsp;

### compelling experience

&nbsp;

### human-focused infrastructure√
the current internet infrastructure does not provide the protections required to guarantee the privacy and security of personal·data  
· a new infrastructure, based on real·identity and strong encryption is needed
&nbsp;

### security by design√
the infrastructure you and the entities you authorize to access your personal·data must guarantee the privacy and security of your data when it is stored and when it is transmitted  
· banks do not rely only on safes to secure cash and security instruments  
· they put those vaults in secure areas within secure buildings with strong doors, alarms, guards, security services, *and* arrangements with police departments  
· we must take a similar approach to ensure that personal·information is always secure  
· *efficiency* must take second place to security  

while in their custody, entities are fully responsible and accountable for the security of your data  
· if your data is not encrypted and the entity’s systems are breached, the entity is accountable for its loss and misuse
