# Humanity Deserves Smart·Software
![](img/software.png)

  >the pursuit of profit for its own sake is war against humanity  
  · many helpful technologies have been birthed from the task of killing large numbers of human beings efficiently, swiftly, and immediately  
  · does that make war inherently good?  
  · indirectly good?  
  · is the cost in human life, infrastructure damage, an societal impact justified by the technological advances that come with wars?  

&nbsp;

people want to work with data and content, not directly with files or the apps that work with those files     
· we naturally organize data and content in groups and categories, depending on the task we are performing and the context under which we are performing that task  
· identifying an app to launch and then a file to open with that app is not the way or minds work  
· instead of files, file·systems, and apps we think about concepts, concept·systems, and knowledge·systems  
· apps are an increasingly archaic form of software that is being slowly replaced by systems that interact with other systems, learn by themselves and from each other, and use their knowledge to help people get things done       

our devices—or more accurately, the software on our devices—must evolve to effectively protect and secure our data and the content we capture and produce, provide ways to dynamically classify and organize that information, and facilitate the interaction of smart software that helps us get the appropriate information, perform tasks, and carry out operations that it can execute more efficiently than we can  
· we need software to move humanity forward, not just to put money in the bank accounts of shortsighted entities whose only motive is profit  
· we need to work on the software that will take humanity to other planets and moons, to other stars, and to higher levels of existence  
· software needs to be smart, knowledgeable, adaptive, autonomous, and helpful  
· and, to benefit humanity, this software has to be built without profit·motive, which infects *everything* it touches and justifies all kinds of irresponsible and criminal behavior from entities that vow to be drivers of innovation and social change  
· just ask [**Facebook** and its partner in crime, **Cambridge Analytica**](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/19/technology/facebook-cambridge-analytica-explained.html)  
· **PBS** produced a very enlightening two·part documentary ([part 1](https://youtu.be/T48KFiHwexM), [part 2](https://youtu.be/3BTqBmb3fJ0)) on Facebook, its business practices, and its attitude toward responsibility, accountability, and profit  

[**Peoples•OS**][PeoplesOS] is the open, robust, secure, reliable, and [humanistic][humanism] operating·system that brings us closer to our true potential by removing barriers and smoothing out our interactions with our data, content, and each other    
· Facebook, Twitter, Apple, or Google will not take humanity to the stars  
· *we* will take ourselves to the stars, with devices that we control and that work on our behalf, not for other entities to [make lots and lots of money](https://youtu.be/di60NYGu03Y)    
&nbsp;

## delivering effective and efficient digital experiences
driving the first mass·market automobiles was a [truly involved endeavor](https://youtu.be/gTL5z32pqtU "YouTube: Model T Driving Instructions")  
· as time goes on, our “driving” experience becomes less focused on the intricate workings of the systems that make the car go and more on, well, anything other than [driving](https://youtu.be/WBkgs4u5tW0 "YouTube: Riding a Waymo self-driving taxi")  

just like corporations are working hard and making huge investments to teach cars how to navigate roads and highways to get people from place to place, Peoples•OS will allow devices to help people accomplish objectives and perform tasks with their data and content  

Peoples•OS will not offer apps  
· Peoples•OS will provide specialized *assistants* (writing·assistants, drawing·assistants, scheduling·assistants, recording·assistants) that help users manage content and data in their purest forms  
· just like you will not have to worry about the layout of roads, speed limits, and traffic, you will not have to worry about where to store a picture you just took so that you can include it in an event·invitation   

Peoples•OS is the open·source operating·system aimed primarily at “regular people” who are not interested in the intricacies of their devices’ operating·systems and architectures (there is a vast majority of people who—without being mechanics—can drive a cars perfectly)  
· these users just want to get things done as fast and simply as possible  
· removing the need to handle files and file·systems and to interact with apps is the first step in providing individuals software they can trust  
· common data formats and storage will benefit both people and companies who will enjoy access to richer, more interconnected data while keeping that data private and secure  
· this approach not only brings people together, but also brings companies together, sharing data and content, and working towards the humanistic goal of moving society forward by ensuring that individuals, groups, and communities can become the best of themselves through technology  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## rethinking people’s interactions with software
there are aspects of being human that should not be under the complete control of one or even a few entities  
· you have a social life full of *thoughts*, not tweets  
· you *communicate* with people, you do not dial, [Skype][Skype], or [FaceTime][FaceTime]    
· you write *content*, not [Google Docs][GoogleDocs] or [Microsoft Office][MicrosoftOffice] documents   

there are many apps you can use to perform each of those tasks  
· sometimes you can work with the same content on more than one app  
· but other times you are forced into a proprietary format  
· each app offers a distinctive user experience, with advantages and disadvantages  
· sometimes those differences are helpful, but most of the time they are an annoyance  
· when it comes to the essential, general content and data you manipulate on a daily basis, multiple apps, multiple interfaces, and multiple formats do not provide a pleasant digital experience  

Peoples•OS and task·assistants represent a new digital experience, more attuned to your capabilities, your curiosity, and your humanity  
&nbsp;

a **task·assistant** is the app replacement that brings you the data, content, and operations you need to 
perform tasks   
· assistants do not have a fixed user interface because the interface you work with is created for the task at hand  
· you do not have to decide *how* to do something  
· all you need to do is decide *what* to do, and the software—leveraging the capabilities of your device—creates the appropriate interface for the task, your context, and your environment (sitting at a desk, speaking with a patient, riding a bicycle)  

an assistant *assists* you while you perform your task by taking care of the boring, repetitive, and error·prone operations, freeing you to use your human faculties, insight, and curiosity in high·level activities  
· guided by your device’s *automated·administrator*, assistants focus on performing a task or operation using past lessons, knowledge, and cooperation  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## providing a smart, trusted device administrator
devices running Peoples•OS are managed by an **automated·device·administrator**, which is a software agent tasked with looking after the user’s data and content, ensuring that it is private (encrypted), and protected against malfunctions, unauthorized access, or tampering (survives malfunctioning storage, and [ransomware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ransomware) attacks)  
· the administrator relieves users from having to manage files and apps  
· instead, users interact with the administrator interface to perform tasks  
· the administrator then calls on the appropriate assistants to perform the operations each task entails, on the appropriate data or content  

the administrator is robust, secure software that runs on a device using reliable subsystems such as [OpenZFS] to store and protect the user’s data  
· the administrator is like a smart and knowledgeable librarian who dutifully and quietly does its job, while the user  enjoys being able to instantly access any piece of content sie wants without worrying about its location in the file·system or the app that can open it  
· devices running Peoples•OS will have standard, open·source task·assistants that can open any human·internet content  
· for·profit entities can develop and make available assistants, but they must make the specifications and source·code for those assistants available for public inspection  

the administrator orchestrates the operations of the assistants working on the device, ensuring that those tasks are completed correctly  
· when things go wrong, the administrator attempts to correct the situation using local knowledge and, if available, knowledge from [**Peoples•Cloud**][PeoplesCloud]  
· if it cannot correct the problem after performing standard troubleshooting operations, the administrator reports the issue to the user  

the administrator is like an automated [type 2 hypervisor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEk0CKoeUnA "YouTube: Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors") or virtual·machine manager    
· it facilitates the operation and cooperation of task·assistants  
· in turn, task·assistants are like [virtual·machines](https://youtu.be/yIVXjl4SwVo) that operate securely under the watchful eye of the administrator  

the administrator can also educate the user on the capabilities of the device, either by walking the user through a tutorial or by answering user inquiries  
· users should not use their devices inefficiently while more efficient ways of accomplishing tasks are available  
· administrators observe the activities of the user so that they can suggest alternatives when they are appropriate for the user, not to target the user with ads from entities with whom the user has no relationship  
· in addition, the administrator can provide the user a detailed but easy·to·understand log of all activity on the device   
&nbsp;

&nbsp;

## building on top of reliable, secure, and resilient infrastructure
a secure, reliable operating·system must be based on proven technology whose developers demonstrate a commitment to security, correctness, and excellence  
· to ensure a highly collaborative and flexible development ecosystem, an important requirement for all components of the operating·system is that they be [**free·and·open·source·software**][FOSS] (FOSS) under a 
[permissive·license][permissive·license]  

these are some of the technologies and products that fit these requirements:

  * [**OpenZFS**][OpenZFS]  
    · this is the premier file·system and volume·manager available  
    · it offers data safety and durability  
    · its ability to create space·efficient snapshots means that users can have confidence that their data is safe even from their own actions  
    · snapshots also facilitate recovery of data made unavailable through ransomware attacks  
    · because OpenZFS stores and manages data across several drives, data can survive the malfunction or failure of one or more of those drives (depending on how many drives make up a particular volume)  
    · this means, though, that devices have to have at least three identical drives to guarantee data safety  

  * [**FreeBSD**][FreeBSD]  
    · this operating·system offers the security and performance that people expect to experience on their devices  
    · it has a vibrant developer community, guided by a group of committed, professional individuals, working together with the goal of developing a solid product  
    · the quality of FreeBSD is palpable in every aspect, including its reputation as a leader in innovation, performance, and reliability, its vast community of developers and contributors, and its documentation  

  * [**OpenBSD**][OpenBSD]  
    · this operating·system has a reputation for being the most secure operating·system available today  
    · its developers are dedicated to providing the most secure and correct code possible, and introducing or implementing widely used security features such as [**IPSec**][IPSec], [**OpenSSH**][OpenSSH], 
    and [**ASLR**][ASLR]  
    · however, it does not provide the first·class OpenZFS integration that FreeBSD offers  

  * [**TrueOS**][TrueOS]
    · this operating·system is based on FreeBSD, and it adds a further commitment to innovation, data safety, security, and privacy  
    · it also serves as an early adopter and testing·bed for unreleased FreeBSD technologies  
    · in this sense, TrueOS both gains new technology from FreeBSD, and contributes tested code back to it  
    · development is completely open through [**GitHub**][TrueOS-GitHub]  
    · this is a good base on which to build Peoples•OS  

  * [**InterPlatetary File System**][IPFS] (IPFS)  
    · IPFS is a network·level file·system that provides global data persistence and ubiquity  
    · this distributed file·system provides encryption functionality that makes data retrieval impossible without the decryption key  
    · this file·system provides inherent snapshots; data is never lost  
    · its distributed nature prevents [**distributed·denial·of·service**][DDoS] (DDoS) attacks because data is replicated across a number of computers (nodes)  
    · it also has the ability to store past versions of data, making it easy to access and analyze historical data  
    · this open·source project provides the base upon which data privacy and security can be implemented at a global scale, the basis of a *new* internet  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## replacing apps with task·assistants
a task·assistant is more than an app  
· it is an entire operating·system using its resources to carry out particular tasks  
· it can comprise a set of components (programs and services) used to perform its function  
· it may also contain knowledge and related data to use in its operations
· however, this data has nothing to do with any person  
· all data and content that pertains to the user resides on the person’s common data store on the person’s device  

assistants are highly capable software systems  
· they are written by experienced software scientists and engineers with extensive knowledge of the system that makes up the assistant, and on the nature of the data the assistant operates  
· they are robust, reliable, and secure  
· the people involved in their development include software professionals, human–machine interaction experts, and data scientists  
· just like new neurosurgeons do not operate on a brain the day after they graduate, newly minted programmers do not write assistants unsupervised  
· like writing airliner software, developing assistants involves a team of experts, rigorous testing, and onerous quality·assurance processes  
· regular users will never be considered beta·testers  

assistants run on Peoples•OS as jailed (virtualized) environments  
· this gives their implementers a lot of flexibility  
· but they also have limited access to the host’s resources and user data (all access is mediated by the automated·administrator)  
· this makes them difficult vehicles for bad actors to use to gain access to a person’s data on eir device  
&nbsp;
&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## interfacing with the human·internet
while having control over our personal data in our devices is great, we are a social species that communicates, collaborates, and relates to other humans on the internet  
· sadly, internet companies have largely let down humanity with their business practices, data misuse, negligence, incompetence, and criminality  
· therefore, we must extend the Peoples•OS strong data privacy and protection capabilities to a new internet, the [**human·internet**][human·internet]  
· through the InterPlanetary File System, the human·internet will be inherently private and secure, giving its denizens a sense of safety and community that the internet of today cannot provide  

instead of task·assistants, the human·internet hosts [**digital·organisms**][digital·organisms], entities that manage data and content on behalf of its owners at a large scale   
· digital organisms are akin to [web·services][web·service] that provide access to information to entities such as content publishers, research organizations, and personal·service providers  
· to access the data, however, these entities must be granted access to it by its owners  
· also, all interactions between these entities and digital·organisms are permanently logged to ensure that data·privacy and data·sharing violations are promptly identified and prosecuted  
· the human·internet will not allow the abuses that internet companies routinely inflict on human beings  

digital·organisms will use IPFS to relieve people from having to manage the privacy and security of their data online  
· IPFS ensures that data is never lost and that it is accessible from anywhere  
· it makes ransomware and distributed·denial·of·service attacks a thing of the past  
· IPFS also provides immediate access to past versions of data, which help people discover and understand personal·information as it evolves  

digital·organisms are long·lived processes that, just like task·assistants, can learn and accumulate experiences that help them to be effective managers of the information that people produce and share  
· digital·organisms serve primarily the people who store their data and content on Peoples•Cloud  
· but they also provide an interface to personal·information to entities that access such information as part of their business  
· task·assistants can work together with digital·organisms to help people perform tasks and complete objectives
